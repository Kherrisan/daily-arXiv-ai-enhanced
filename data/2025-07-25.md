### [1] [Performance Evaluation and Threat Mitigation in Large-scale 5G Core Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17850)
*Rodrigo Moreira,Larissa F. Rodrigues Moreira,Fl√°vio de Oliveira Silva*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of DDoS-induced chaotic workloads on 5G core network functions (NFs), emphasizing resource-profile diversity for SLA compliance, kernel-based monitoring for security, and empirical insights for deployment in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G core deployments face significant challenges in resource provisioning due to the need for optimization and intelligence. Prior studies focus on mathematical models and AI, but the effect of DDoS-driven chaos on user registration performance remains underexplored, necessitating practical approaches to ensure SLA compliance.

Method: The study analyzes the effects of chaotic workloads from DDoS attacks on various Network Functions (NFs) using packet capture approaches and empirical evaluations to assess resource provisioning strategies and security monitoring effectiveness.

Result: Diverse resource profiles are critical to maintaining SLA compliance under chaotic workloads. Kernel-based monitoring demonstrates scalability in defending against security threats, and empirical data reveals key insights for deploying 5G NFs in complex environments.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the need for adaptive resource allocation and kernel-level security monitoring to address DDoS challenges in large-scale 5G deployments, supported by empirical evidence for optimizing NF performance and SLA adherence.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale software-based 5G core functions presents
significant challenges due to their reliance on optimized and intelligent
resource provisioning for their services. Many studies have focused on
analyzing the impact of resource allocation for complex deployments using
mathematical models, queue theories, or even Artificial Intelligence (AI). This
paper elucidates the effects of chaotic workloads, generated by Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) on different Network Functions (NFs) on User Equipment
registration performance. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse
resource profiles to ensure Service-Level Agreement (SLA) compliance in
large-scale 5G core deployments. Additionally, our analysis of packet capture
approaches demonstrates the potential of kernel-based monitoring for scalable
security threat defense. Finally, our empirical evaluation provides insights
into the effective deployment of 5G NFs in complex scenarios.

### [2] [Learning to Locate: GNN-Powered Vulnerability Path Discovery in Open Source Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17888)
*Nima Atashin,Behrouz Tork Ladani,Mohammadreza Sharbaf*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: VulPathFinder is an explainable vulnerability path discovery framework using a novel GNN model for detecting sink statements and capturing dependencies to improve root cause explanations beyond rule-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vulnerability detection and path explanation, such as SliceLocator, rely on predefined rules for sink identification, which limits their generalization. This necessitates a more flexible, accurate approach using semantic analysis to enhance vulnerability explanations and pinpoint root causes effectively.

Method: The framework employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to detect potential sink statements (PSPs) by learning semantic and syntactic dependencies. These PSPs are used in conjunction with program slicing to extract vulnerable paths, which are subsequently ranked using a graph-based detector to prioritize high-probability root causes.

Result: Evaluations on buffer overflow vulnerabilities from the SARD dataset demonstrate that VulPathFinder significantly outperforms SliceLocator and GNNExplainer in the discovery of vulnerability paths to identified PSPs, suggesting effective improvements in generalization and accuracy.

Conclusion: VulPathFinder offers a robust and explainable solution for vulnerability path discovery, surpassing current frameworks by leveraging GNNs to automatically detect sink points and explain root causes with high precision, thereby enhancing vulnerability analysis in open-source software.

Abstract: Detecting security vulnerabilities in open-source software is a critical task
that is highly regarded in the related research communities. Several approaches
have been proposed in the literature for detecting vulnerable codes and
identifying the classes of vulnerabilities. However, there is still room to
work in explaining the root causes of detected vulnerabilities through locating
vulnerable statements and the discovery of paths leading to the activation of
the vulnerability. While frameworks like SliceLocator offer explanations by
identifying vulnerable paths, they rely on rule-based sink identification that
limits their generalization. In this paper, we introduce VulPathFinder, an
explainable vulnerability path discovery framework that enhances SliceLocator's
methodology by utilizing a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for detecting
sink statements, rather than relying on predefined rules. The proposed GNN
captures semantic and syntactic dependencies to find potential sink points
(PSPs), which are candidate statements where vulnerable paths end. After
detecting PSPs, program slicing can be used to extract potentially vulnerable
paths, which are then ranked by feeding them back into the target graph-based
detector. Ultimately, the most probable path is returned, explaining the root
cause of the detected vulnerability. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the
proposed approach by performing evaluations on a benchmark of the buffer
overflow CWEs from the SARD dataset, providing explanations for the
corresponding detected vulnerabilities. The results show that VulPathFinder
outperforms both original SliceLocator and GNNExplainer (as a general GNN
explainability tool) in discovery of vulnerability paths to identified PSPs.

*Russell O'Connor,Andrew Poelstra*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper verifies the correctness of libsecp256k1's modular inverse implementation using Coq and separation logic to ensure cryptographic security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novel algorithms like Bernstein and Yang's extended Euclidean method for modular inversion in Bitcoin's libsecp256k1 introduce potential errors, necessitating formal verification for security.

Method: The authors used the Coq proof assistant and Verifiable C's separation logic to conduct a computer-verified proof of the implementation's correctness.

Result: A verified proof confirms the correctness of the modular inverse algorithm in libsecp256k1, addressing risks associated with new cryptographic methods.

Conclusion: Formal verification of cryptographic implementations using tools like Coq and separation logic is critical for ensuring security and correctness in high-stakes applications such as Bitcoin.

Abstract: The modular inverse is an essential piece of computation required for
elliptic curve operations used for digital signatures in Bitcoin and other
applications. A novel approach to the extended Euclidean algorithm has been
developed by Bernstein and Yang within the last few years and incorporated into
the libsecp256k1 cryptographic library used by Bitcoin. However, novel
algorithms introduce new risks of errors. To address this we have completed a
computer verified proof of the correctness of (one of) libsecp256k1's modular
inverse implementations with the Coq proof assistant using the Verifiable C's
implementation of separation logic.

### [4] [TimelyHLS: LLM-Based Timing-Aware and Architecture-Specific FPGA HLS Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17962)
*Nowfel Mashnoor,Mohammad Akyash,Hadi Kamali,Kimia Azar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TimelyHLS is an LLM-RAG-based framework that automates FPGA HLS code generation and optimization, reducing manual tuning by 70% and achieving significant latency/area improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual optimization of HLS code for FPGA timing and area is labor-intensive due to complex interactions between architecture constraints, resource usage, and platform-specific pragmas lacking automation.

Method: The framework uses a knowledge base of FPGA features, synthesis directives, and pragma templates to generate HLS code with timing-critical and design-specific pragmas. It iteratively refines code using synthesis logs and performance reports through LLM-driven RAG.

Result: Across 10 FPGA architectures and benchmarks, TimelyHLS achieved up to 4x latency speedup (e.g., Matrix Multiplication) and 57% area savings (e.g., in Viterbi decoder), while maintaining timing closure and functional correctness.

Conclusion: TimelyHLS demonstrates the viability of LLM-powered architecture-aware synthesis for automating FPGA design optimization and timing closure, reducing design effort.

Abstract: Achieving timing closure and design-specific optimizations in FPGA-targeted
High-Level Synthesis (HLS) remains a significant challenge due to the complex
interaction between architectural constraints, resource utilization, and the
absence of automated support for platform-specific pragmas. In this work, we
propose TimelyHLS, a novel framework integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automatically generate and
iteratively refine HLS code optimized for FPGA-specific timing and performance
requirements. TimelyHLS is driven by a structured architectural knowledge base
containing FPGA-specific features, synthesis directives, and pragma templates.
Given a kernel, TimelyHLS generates HLS code annotated with both
timing-critical and design-specific pragmas. The synthesized RTL is then
evaluated using commercial toolchains, and simulation correctness is verified
against reference outputs via custom testbenches. TimelyHLS iteratively
incorporates synthesis logs and performance reports into the LLM engine for
refinement in the presence of functional discrepancies. Experimental results
across 10 FPGA architectures and diverse benchmarks show that TimelyHLS reduces
the need for manual tuning by up to 70%, while achieving up to 4x latency
speedup (e.g., 3.85x for Matrix Multiplication, 3.7x for Bitonic Sort) and over
50% area savings in certain cases (e.g., 57% FF reduction in Viterbi).
TimelyHLS consistently achieves timing closure and functional correctness
across platforms, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-driven,
architecture-aware synthesis in automating FPGA design.

TL;DR: Introduces MeAJOR Corpus, a novel multi-source phishing email dataset combining 135,894 samples across diverse tactics and legitimate emails, achieving 98.34% F1 in phishing detection experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML-based phishing detection models face performance limitations due to insufficient training data quality/diversity in existing resources.

Method: Integrated 135894 samples from joint open-source repositories with engineered features, evaluated through four models (RF, XGB, MLP, CNN) across multiple feature configurations.

Result: XGB model achieved 98.34% F1 score, demonstrating dataset effectiveness and addressing class imbalance, generalizability, and reproducibility challenges.

Conclusion: MeAJOR Corpus provides a reusable, consistent resource for phishing detection research by overcoming critical limitations in existing datasets through multi-source integration and diverse feature engineering.

Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a significant threat to cybersecurity by
exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive content and malicious

phishing threats, their performance largely relies on the quality and diversity
of the training data. This paper presents MeAJOR (Merged email Assets from
Joint Open-source Repositories) Corpus, a novel, multi-source phishing email
dataset designed to overcome critical limitations in existing resources. It
integrates 135894 samples representing a broad number of phishing tactics and
legitimate emails, with a wide spectrum of engineered features. We evaluated
the dataset's utility for phishing detection research through systematic
experiments with four classification models (RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN) across
multiple feature configurations. Results highlight the dataset's effectiveness,
achieving 98.34% F1 with XGB. By integrating broad features from multiple
categories, our dataset provides a reusable and consistent resource, while
addressing common challenges like class imbalance, generalisability and
reproducibility.

### [6] [Removing Box-Free Watermarks for Image-to-Image Models via Query-Based Reverse Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18034)
*Haonan An,Guang Hua,Hangcheng Cao,Zhengru Fang,Guowen Xu,Susanto Rahardja,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper identifies a vulnerability in box-free model watermarking systems where attackers can reverse-engineer hidden deep generative network outputs through query-based methods, achieving 100% watermark removal and high image quality, necessitating stronger defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current box-free watermarking systems assume their black-box nature ensures security, but an overlooked vulnerability allows attackers to reliably estimate unwatermarked content despite limited system knowledge.

Method: 1) Reverse-engineers an inverse HNet model using curated input queries under black-box constraints. 2) Proposes an improved method leveraging the additive property of box-free watermarking to create a forward surrogate model of HNet.

Result: Both attacks achieved perfect watermark removal (100% success) with strong image quality (peak PSNR value of 34.69 dB), significantly outperforming existing attacks in image generation and processing tasks.

Conclusion: The identified vulnerability in box-free model watermarking systems demonstrates the need for robust defensive strategies to prevent query-based reverse-engineering and content IP theft.

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep generative networks (GNets) can be
protected using a cascaded hiding network (HNet) which embeds watermarks (or
marks) into GNet outputs, known as box-free watermarking. Although both GNet
and HNet are encapsulated in a black box (called operation network, or ONet),
with only the generated and marked outputs from HNet being released to end
users and deemed secure, in this paper, we reveal an overlooked vulnerability
in such systems. Specifically, we show that the hidden GNet outputs can still
be reliably estimated via query-based reverse engineering, leaking the
generated and unmarked images, despite the attacker's limited knowledge of the
system. Our first attempt is to reverse-engineer an inverse model for HNet
under the stringent black-box condition, for which we propose to exploit the
query process with specially curated input images. While effective, this method
yields unsatisfactory image quality. To improve this, we subsequently propose
an alternative method leveraging the equivalent additive property of box-free
model watermarking and reverse-engineering a forward surrogate model of HNet,
with better image quality preservation. Extensive experimental results on image
processing and image generation tasks demonstrate that both attacks achieve
impressive watermark removal success rates (100%) while also maintaining
excellent image quality (reaching the highest PSNR of 34.69 dB), substantially
outperforming existing attacks, highlighting the urgent need for robust
defensive strategies to mitigate the identified vulnerability in box-free model
watermarking.

### [7] [NWaaS: Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service for X-to-Image DNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18036)
*Haonan An,Guang Hua,Yu Guo,Hangcheng Cao,Susanto Rahardja,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service (NWaaS) and ShadowMark, a method to embed and extract watermarks in X-to-Image deep neural networks without modifying model parameters, structure, or output behavior. This addresses the limitations of current DNN watermarking techniques and enables robust, trustworthy, and universal model protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DNN watermarking methods require model modifications (parameter or structural changes), which alter behavior, increase fine-tuning costs, and have fidelity-robustness trade-offs. These issues limit practical adoption of Watermarking as a Service (WaaS).

Method: ShadowMark leverages a key encoder and watermark decoder in the protected model's black-box API to create a 'side channel' for watermark extraction without changing the model's architecture or parameters. This achieves absolute fidelity and robustness against attacks simultaneously.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate ShadowMark's efficacy in protecting image-to-image, noise-to-image, and text-to-image models while maintaining output fidelity and robustness against watermark removal and model reconstruction attacks.

Conclusion: ShadowMark resolves the fidelity-robustness trade-off in DNN watermarking through a nonintrusive API-based approach, enabling universal and trustworthy model protection for practical WaaS deployment.

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep neural network (DNN) models can be
protected with DNN watermarking, which embeds copyright watermarks into model
parameters (white-box), model behavior (black-box), or model outputs
(box-free), and the watermarks can be subsequently extracted to verify model
ownership or detect model theft. Despite recent advances, these existing
methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or
alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about
watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of
fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a
result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,
which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)
systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a
Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in
which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark
can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose
ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical
deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in
the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark
decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining
the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN
architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating
the fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,
noise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate
the efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of
nonintrusive DNN watermarking.

### [8] [RECALLED: An Unbounded Resource Consumption Attack on Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18053)
*Haoran Gao,Yuanhe Zhang,Zhenhong Zhou,Lei Jiang,Fanyu Meng,Yujia Xiao,Kun Wang,Yang Liu,Junlan Feng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces RECALLED, the first visual modality-based resource consumption attack framework for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which exploits adversarial perturbations in visual inputs to trigger unbounded output generations, causing significant service latency and GPU resource overconsumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red-teaming studies on LLM security have neglected visual inputs as attack vectors in LVLMs, leaving critical vulnerabilities unaddressed in resource consumption attacks (RCAs) that exploit text prompts.

Method: The approach combines Vision Guided Optimization (pixel-level adversarial perturbation generation for output repetition) and Multi-Objective Parallel Losses (to create universal attack templates and resolve parallel attack optimization conflicts).

Result: RECALLED demonstrates 26% increased service latency with 20% higher GPU utilization and memory consumption under realistic LVLM inference scenarios.

Conclusion: The study reveals unaddressed security risks in LVLM multimodal architectures and proposes a novel red-teaming framework that could inform future mitigation strategies for resource consumption attacks in vision-language AI systems.

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

### [9] [PyPitfall: Dependency Chaos and Software Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18075)
*Jacob Mahon,Chenxi Hou,Zhihao Yao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PyPitfall quantitatively analyzes vulnerable dependencies in PyPI, finding that 4,655 packages directly require vulnerable versions while 141,044 permit them within version ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of comprehensive analysis on vulnerable dependencies in PyPI's complex supply chain motivates the study to raise security awareness and address propagation of vulnerabilities.

Method: The researchers analyzed dependency structures for 378,573 PyPI packages, identifying direct and indirect vulnerabilities through explicit version requirements and range specifications.

Result: 4,655 direct vulnerable dependencies and 141,044 transitive/indirect vulnerable dependencies were identified, revealing significant security risks across the ecosystem.

Conclusion: The study reveals the widespread presence of vulnerable dependencies in PyPI, emphasizing the critical need for tools and practices to mitigate transitive dependency risks in Python software supply chains.

Abstract: Python software development heavily relies on third-party packages. Direct
and transitive dependencies create a labyrinth of software supply chains. While
it is convenient to reuse code, vulnerabilities within these dependency chains
can propagate through dependencies, potentially affecting down-stream packages
and applications. PyPI, the official Python package repository, hosts many
packages and lacks a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of vulnerable
dependencies. This paper introduces PyPitfall, a quantitative analysis of
vulnerable dependencies across the PyPI ecosystem. We analyzed the dependency
structures of 378,573 PyPI packages and identified 4,655 packages that
explicitly require at least one known-vulnerable version and 141,044 packages
that permit vulnerable versions within specified ranges. By characterizing the
ecosystem-wide dependency landscape and the security impact of transitive
dependencies, we aim to raise awareness of Python software supply chain
security.

### [10] [An Improved ChaCha Algorithm Based on Quantum Random Number](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18157)
*Chao Liu,Shuai Zhao,Chenhao Jia,Gengran Hu,Tingting Cui*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: QRE-ChaCha enhances ChaCha cipher's security by integrating quantum random numbers, improving resistance to differential attacks and maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ChaCha's efficiency and security against timing/side-channel attacks make it popular, but AI and quantum computing advances threaten its implementation. Strengthening it against these emerging threats is crucial.

Method: 1) XOR initial constants with quantum random numbers. 2) Periodically inject QRNs into state words during odd rounds. 3) Use SAT-based differential cryptanalysis for attack testing. 4) Apply NIST and GM/T 0005-2021 tests to keystream and measure file encryption speeds.

Result: Demonstrated stronger differential attack resistance, keystream passed NIST/GM/T randomness tests, and maintained original ChaCha's high efficiency across file sizes.

Conclusion: QRE-ChaCha achieves enhanced security against classical/quantum attacks while preserving efficiency, satisfying cryptographic application requirements through statistical validation.

Abstract: Due to the merits of high efficiency and strong security against timing and
side-channel attacks, ChaCha has been widely applied in real-time communication
and data streaming scenarios. However, with the rapid development of
AI-assisted cryptanalysis and quantum computing technologies, there are serious
challenges to the secure implementation of ChaCha cipher. To further strengthen
the security of ChaCha cipher, we propose an improved variant based on quantum
random numbers, i.e., Quantum Random Number Enhanced ChaCha (QRE-ChaCha).
Specifically, the design XORs the initial constants with quantum random numbers
and periodically injects quantum random numbers into selected state words
during odd rounds to enhance diffusion. Compared with the original ChaCha, the
present variant shows stronger resistance to differential attacks and generates
a keystream with statistical randomness, thereby offering increased robustness
against both classical and quantum attacks. To evaluate the security and
performance of the present ChaCha, our analysis proceeds in three main parts.
Firstly, we analyze its theoretical security in terms of quantum randomness and
attack testing, and conduct differential cryptanalysis with an automated search
method based on the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Secondly, we subject
the keystream generated by the cipher to randomness tests using the NIST
statistical test suite and the GM/T 0005-2021 randomness testing standard.
Finally, we assess its encryption and decryption performance by measuring its
encryption speed on files of various sizes. According to the results, the
present ChaCha is significantly improved to resist differential attacks while
maintaining the high efficiency of the original ChaCha cipher, and its
keystream successfully passes statistical randomness tests using the NIST and
GM/T 0005-2021 standards, meeting cryptographic application requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional information security protection methods struggle to cope with complex and evolving threats, necessitating the exploration of intelligent technologies like LLMs to enhance security performance.

Method: The study systematically reviews LLMs' applications in malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, vulnerability detection, malicious code identification, and cryptographic optimization. It analyzes their technical basis using neural networks and Transformer architecture.

Result: LLMs demonstrate improved detection accuracy and reduced false alarm rates in security systems, as shown through analysis of their performance in the discussed applications.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in advancing information security, challenges such as model transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability remain. Future work should focus on optimizing model structures and generalization capabilities for smarter security systems.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and
traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing
threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language
models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of
information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in
information security, systematically review its application progress in
malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, system vulnerability
detection, malicious code identification, and cryptographic algorithm
optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection
performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper
analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in
natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large
language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false
alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current
application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model
transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It
is necessary to explore further the optimization of the model structure and the
improvement of the generalization ability to realize a more intelligent and
accurate information security protection system.

### [12] [Auto-SGCR: Automated Generation of Smart Grid Cyber Range Using IEC 61850 Standard Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18249)
*Muhammad M. Roomi,S. M. Suhail Hussain,Ee-Chien Chang,David M. Nicol,Daisuke Mashima*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents an automated framework for generating smart grid cyber ranges using an XML-based modeling language (SG-ML), addressing scalability, configurability, and accessibility challenges through open-source toolchains and case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitalization has increased power grids' vulnerability to cyber-attacks, necessitating iterative testing and training. Existing cyber ranges are expensive, inflexible, and difficult to reproduce, creating a gap between academic research and production environments.

Method: The authors designed SG-ML, an XML language integrating IEC 61850 files for modeling smart grid infrastructure, and developed a toolchain to automate cyber range creation, configuration, and deployment from SG-ML models.

Result: The Auto-SGCR framework successfully demonstrates customizable and reproducible cyber ranges via large-scale substation case studies. Toolchains and example SG-ML models are open-sourced to promote collaboration and reuse.

Conclusion: Auto-SGCR reduces costs and complexity in smart grid cybersecurity testing by enabling rapid deployment of high-fidelity, reusable cyber ranges, fostering closer alignment between research and real-world grid defenses.

Abstract: Digitalization of power grids have made them increasingly susceptible to
cyber-attacks in the past decade. Iterative cybersecurity testing is
indispensable to counter emerging attack vectors and to ensure dependability of
critical infrastructure. Furthermore, these can be used to evaluate
cybersecurity configuration, effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures
against various attack vectors, as well as to train smart grid cybersecurity
experts defending the system. Enabling extensive experiments narrows the gap
between academic research and production environment. A high-fidelity cyber
range is vital as it is often infeasible to conduct such experiments and
training using production environment. However, the design and implementation
of cyber range requires extensive domain knowledge of physical and cyber aspect
of the infrastructure. Furthermore, costs incurred for setup and maintenance of
cyber range are significant. Moreover, most existing smart grid cyber ranges
are designed as a one-off, proprietary system, and are limited in terms of
configurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. To address
these challenges, an automated Smart grid Cyber Range generation framework is
presented in this paper. Initially a human-/machine-friendly, XML-based
modeling language called Smart Grid Modeling Language was defined, which
incorporates IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. Subsequently, a
toolchain to parse SG-ML model files and automatically instantiate a functional
smart grid cyber range was developed. The developed SG-ML models can be easily
shared and/or modified to reproduce or customize for any cyber range. The
application of Auto-SGCR is demonstrated through case studies with large-scale
substation models. The toolchain along with example SG-ML models have been
open-sourced.

### [13] [LoRA-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks Against LoRA Fine-tuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18302)
*Delong Ran,Xinlei He,Tianshuo Cong,Anyu Wang,Qi Li,Xiaoyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the vulnerability of LoRA-fine-tuned Language Models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by introducing LoRA-Leak, a comprehensive evaluation framework demonstrating that pre-trained models contribute to information leakage despite LoRA's lightweight tuning. Experiments show high MIA effectiveness (0.775 AUC) and identify dropout and selective layer exclusion as effective defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used for efficient LM fine-tuning with minimal parameter adjustments, existing MIAs overlook information leakage risks from the pre-trained model component, leaving potential privacy vulnerabilities unaddressed.

Method: Developed LoRA-Leak framework incorporating 15 MIAs (10 existing, 5 pre-trained model-aware variants) to evaluate fine-tuning dataset vulnerabilities across three NLP tasks. Analyzed varying fine-tuning configurations and tested four defensive strategies.

Result: LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs exhibit significant MIA vulnerability (up to 0.775 AUC on conservative settings). Defenses: dropout and specific layer exclusion during fine-tuning effectively reduce MIA risks without compromising utility.

Conclusion: The 'pre-training and fine-tuning' paradigm inherently increases MIA risks for LoRA-based systems due to pre-trained model interactions. Practical defenses exist but highlight the need for stronger data privacy measures in specialized LM deployments.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes data anonymization techniques to ensure compliance with regulations like LGPD and GDPR while maintaining data utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The implementation of data protection laws such as LGPD and GDPR necessitates the use of effective data anonymization methods to safeguard personal information and meet legal requirements.

Method: The study investigates and applies aggregation, generalization, perturbation, and k-anonymity techniques to datasets with personal and sensitive data to assess their effectiveness.

Result: The analysis revealed significant differences in the effectiveness of anonymization methods, emphasizing the trade-off between privacy compliance and data utility.

Conclusion: Balancing privacy and data utility is critical, as no single anonymization technique is universally optimal, requiring context-specific selection and adaptation.

Abstract: The protection of personal data has become a central topic in software
development, especially with the implementation of the General Data Protection
Law (LGPD) in Brazil and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the
European Union. With the enforcement of these laws, certain software quality
criteria have become mandatory, such as data anonymization, which is one of the
main aspects addressed by these regulations. The aim of this article is to
analyze data anonymization techniques and assess their effectiveness in
ensuring compliance with legal requirements and the utility of the data for its
intended purpose. Techniques such as aggregation, generalization, perturbation,
and k-anonymity were investigated and applied to datasets containing personal
and sensitive data. The analysis revealed significant variations in the
effectiveness of each method, highlighting the need to balance privacy and data
utility.

### [15] [Scout: Leveraging Large Language Models for Rapid Digital Evidence Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18478)
*Shariq Murtuza*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Scout is a digital forensics framework that leverages large language models and multimodal models to efficiently process and prioritize digital evidence, addressing challenges from increasing data complexity and volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the growing prevalence of powerful consumer-grade devices, which complicate legal investigations by generating huge data volumes with many irrelevant results (false positives) to sift through manually using traditional tools.

Method: Scout employs foundational text-based LLMs to identify relevant artifacts in textual evidence files while using multimodal models for analyzing multimedia files (audio, video, images, office docs) alongside disk images and network packets.

Result: Scout successfully identified and prioritized potentially relevant evidence files in digital investigations, reducing manual effort and false positives compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools to revolutionize digital forensics by enabling scalable, efficient preliminary evidence analysis through specialized language and multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent technological advancements and the prevalence of technology in day to
day activities have caused a major increase in the likelihood of the
involvement of digital evidence in more and more legal investigations.
Consumer-grade hardware is growing more powerful, with expanding memory and
storage sizes and enhanced processor capabilities. Forensics investigators
often have to sift through gigabytes of data during an ongoing investigation
making the process tedious. Memory forensics, disk analysis all are well
supported by state of the art tools that significantly lower the effort
required to be put in by a forensic investigator by providing string searches,
analyzing images file etc. During the course of the investigation a lot of
false positives are identified that need to be lowered. This work presents
Scout, a digital forensics framework that performs preliminary evidence
processing and prioritizing using large language models. Scout deploys
foundational language models to identify relevant artifacts from a large number
of potential evidence files (disk images, captured network packets, memory
dumps etc.) which would have taken longer to get identified. Scout employs text
based large language models can easily process files with textual information.
For the forensic analysis of multimedia files like audio, image, video, office
documents etc. multimodal models are employed by Scout. Scout was able to
identify and realize the evidence file that were of potential interest for the
investigator.

### [16] [Layer-Aware Representation Filtering: Purifying Finetuning Data to Preserve LLM Safety Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18631)
*Hao Li,Lijun Li,Zhenghao Lu,Xianyi Wei,Rui Li,Jing Shao,Lei Sha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses safety degradation in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) by proposing LARF, a Layer-Aware Representation Filtering method to identify and remove harmful features from datasets. Experiments show this improves safety alignment preservation during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning aligned LLMs for real-world applications risks compromising their safety alignment, even with benign datasets. Recent studies reveal hidden safety-degrading features in standard datasets that make models more vulnerable to malicious instructions.

Method: LARF identifies safety-sensitive layers in LLMs and analyzes their representations to detect data samples containing safety-degrading features during fine-tuning.

Result: LARF effectively identifies safety-compromising data samples without obvious harmful content. Removing these samples mitigates safety alignment degradation in fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that hidden safety-degrading features exist in fine-tuning datasets and proposes LARF as an effective solution to preserve safety alignment through layer-aware representation analysis. Open-sourced code available at https://github.com/LLLeoLi/LARF.

Abstract: With rapid advancement and increasing accessibility of LLMs, fine-tuning
aligned models has become a critical step for adapting them to real-world
applications, which makes the safety of this fine-tuning process more important
than ever. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical challenge: even
when fine-tuning with seemingly benign downstream datasets, the safety of
aligned LLMs can be compromised, making them more susceptible to malicious
instructions. In this paper, we show that fine-tuning datasets often contain
samples with safety-degrading features that are not easily identifiable on the
surface. These samples can significantly degrade the safety alignment of LLMs
during fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose LARF, a
\textbf{L}ayer-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{F}iltering
method. This method identifies safety-sensitive layers within the LLM and
leverages their representations to detect which data samples in the
post-training dataset contain safety-degrading features. Experimental results
demonstrate that LARF can effectively identify benign data with
safety-degrading features. After removing such data, the safety alignment
degradation caused by fine-tuning is mitigated. Please see our code at

*Vahid Garousi,Zafar Jafarov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes AI tool usage in Software Engineering through a process model and decision framework based on industry observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT enable new coding workflows, but understanding developer decisions about trust/refinement of AI outputs in real-world SE contexts is critically underexplored, especially in balancing effort vs. quality trade-offs.

Method: Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observational studies across three industry settings in Turkey and Azerbaijan, employing qualitative analysis to extract patterns in human-AI collaborative workflows.

Result: 1) Pragmatic AI-assisted SE process model encompassing prompt design, inspection, fallback, refinement activities
2) 2D decision framework for evaluating effort savings vs. output quality trade-offs
3) Contextual insights into daily AI usage patterns with human oversight mechanisms

Conclusion: The proposed models provide lightweight guidance for deliberate AI integration in SE, advancing practical understanding of human-AI collaboration dynamics through concrete industry examples and decision-support structures.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform Software
Engineering (SE) by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision support.
Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an
exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers
engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to
trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This
paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process
model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design,
inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that
could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output
quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three
industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how
engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured,
lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools
in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper compares 11 automated tools for improving scientific reproducibility across 9 rigor criteria, identifying performance leaders and combination advantages while offering developer recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reproducibility crisis in science stems from inadequate standardization and transparency, despite existing checklists like ARRIVE and CONSORT. Current tools often fall short in enforcement and detection.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 11 automated tools using 9 rigor criteria from the ScreenIT framework to assess their effectiveness in identifying missing transparency elements.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance of specific tools for open data detection, improved accuracy through tool combinations for inclusion/exclusion criteria, and identified critical development gaps for tool creators.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for optimizing automated rigor detection tools and highlights collaborative approaches between developers and stakeholders to enhance scientific transparency.

Abstract: The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and
transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT
seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and
peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues,
there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different
rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools
across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some
criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed
a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other
cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination
of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas
where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally
useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders
in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data

*Xiang Echo Chen,Wenhan Zhu,Guoshuai Albert Shi,Michael W. Godfrey*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the adoption of generative AI (GenAI) in open-source game development by analyzing GitHub issues, comparing GenAI-related discussions to traditional AI (TradAI) and non-AI topics, and examining associated tools, tasks, and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses a gap in empirical understanding of how GenAI technologies are adopted by open-source developers, particularly in contrast to traditional AI and non-AI approaches, and how they impact workflows and challenges in real-world implementation.

Method: The researchers built a dataset of open-source game repositories mentioning AI-related topics and conducted open card sorting and thematic analysis on a stratified sample of GitHub issues. Issues were labeled according to type and content to enable comparative analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups.

Result: The analysis provides empirical characterizations of GenAI vs. non-GenAI AI usage in open-source game development, identifying tools, tasks, and challenges specific to GenAI adoption while highlighting distinct patterns of usage, concerns, and integration practices between the groups.

Conclusion: Through systematic empirical analysis, the study reveals how GenAI is shaping open-source game development workflows and pain points, offering actionable insights for both researchers and developers regarding AI adoption patterns in this specific context.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) have begun to reshape how
games are designed and developed, offering new tools for content creation,
gameplay simulation, and design ideation. While prior research has explored
traditional uses of AI in games, such as controlling agents or generating
procedural content. There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is
adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source
community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed,
adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue
discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges
associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving
traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI
differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns,
and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of
open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open
card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues,
labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative
analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how
GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.

*Sivana Hamer,Jacob Bowen,Md Nazmul Haque,Chris Madden,Laurie Williams*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a mapping between MITRE ATT&CK attack techniques and the P-SSCRM framework to help organizations mitigate software supply chain risks through proactive tasks aligned with government/industry standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations need actionable guidance to translate attack knowledge (MITRE ATT&CK) into effective supply chain risk mitigation strategies, but such structured mappings were previously lacking.

Method: The authors established mappings using four independent methods to identify consensus-aligned task-technique relationships, cross-referencing P-SSCRM with 10 existing frameworks.

Result: A comprehensive mapping matrix linking MITRE ATT&CK techniques to 65 P-SSCRM tasks and demonstrating connections between these tasks and 10 external frameworks was developed.

Conclusion: This work provides a critical bridge between adversarial threat knowledge and proactive supply chain risk management, enhancing the utility of both MITRE ATT&CK and P-SSCRM for organizational defense planning.

Abstract: The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (MITRE ATT&CK)
Attack Technique to Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework
(P-SSCRM) Task mapping described in this document helps software organizations
to determine how different tasks mitigate the attack techniques of software
supply chain attacks. The mapping was created through four independent
strategies to find agreed-upon mappings. Because each P-SSCRM task is mapped to
one or more tasks from the 10 frameworks, the mapping we provide is also a
mapping between MITRE ATT&CK and other prominent government and industry
frameworks.

### [21] [Factors Impacting Faculty Adoption of Project-Based Learning in Computing Education: a Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18039)
*Ahmad D. Suleiman,Yiming Tang,Daqing Hou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines barriers and facilitators to computing educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering curricula, emphasizing the need for systemic institutional support to overcome challenges like project design and resource limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite PjBL's known benefits (student motivation, problem-solving skills), its adoption remains inconsistent due to faculty hesitation over implementation challenges, prompting research into effective support strategies and barriers to implementation.

Method: Mixed-methods approach combining quantitative analysis (statistical methods on 80 faculty survey responses) and qualitative thematic analysis of open-ended feedback to assess PjBL adoption barriers and facilitators.

Result: Identified key barriers: insufficient institutional support (time, funding, teaching assistants), project design/alignment with course goals, and process management. Key enablers included peer collaboration, professional development, institutional incentives, and project sourcing from research/industry/peers.

Conclusion: Successful PjBL adoption requires systemic institutional support frameworks, including resource allocation, professional development opportunities, and collaborative networks to address planning, project design, and sustainability challenges.

Abstract: This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing
educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering
and computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,
PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical
thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,
faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient
institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,
designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This
research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources
that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data
from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising
closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,
along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative
data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses
underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,
its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and
managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of
institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty
are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer
collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In
addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing
from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings
underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to
experiment with and scale PjBL practices.

### [22] [An Empirical Study of Complexity, Heterogeneity, and Compliance of GitHub Actions Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18062)
*Edward Abrokwah,Taher A. Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study investigates the structure and compliance of GitHub Actions workflows in open-source repositories, analyzing complexities and cross-language differences to inform improvements in CI documentation and practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous Integration (CI) has become a core mindset, yet there's limited empirical understanding of how real-world GitHub Actions (GHA) workflows align with best practices. Many workflows may be overly complex, requiring deeper analysis.

Method: Analyzes a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++ repositories to identify structural patterns, complexities, compliance with best practices, and cross-language design variations.

Result: Expected to reveal strong adherence to and deviations from GHA best practices, uncovering workflow complexities, recurring patterns, and differences in pipeline design across programming languages.

Conclusion: The findings will highlight the need for clearer GHA documentation, comprehensive examples, and address gaps where workflows fall short of simplicity and best practices, benefiting both developers and CI service providers.

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) has evolved from a tooling strategy to a
fundamental mindset in modern CI engineering. It enables teams to develop,
test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services,
GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep
integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions.
Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best
practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how
open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows
might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI
practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity,
heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software
repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++
repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze
recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with
GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across
programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong
adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These
insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight
the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.

*Carol Wong,Mai Abe,Silvia De Benedictis,Marissa Halim,Anthony Peruma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a taxonomy for identifier name similarity in codebases to evaluate its impact on comprehension and collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poorly chosen identifier names increase cognitive load and hinder collaboration, and even readable names can cause confusion when similar to others.

Method: Development of a taxonomy categorizing different forms of identifier name similarity through an exploratory study.

Result: Preliminary taxonomy details and findings on name similarity occurrence in software projects.

Conclusion: The taxonomy serves as a foundation for further research on name similarity's effects and potential refinement.

Abstract: Identifier names, which comprise a significant portion of the codebase, are
the cornerstone of effective program comprehension. However, research has shown
that poorly chosen names can significantly increase cognitive load and hinder
collaboration. Even names that appear readable in isolation may lead to
misunderstandings in contexts when they closely resemble other names in either
structure or functionality. In this exploratory study, we present our
preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in
software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes
different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy
providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of
identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and
collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and
expansion of the taxonomy.

*Yujie Ma,Lili Quan,Xiaofei Xie,Qiang Hu,Jiongchi Yu,Yao Zhang,Sen Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Introduces the first comprehensive dataset for benchmarking Large Language Model (LLM) supply chain security risks, revealing significant vulnerabilities in LLM-based systems and their dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM risk assessments focus narrowly on models/data, neglecting interconnected supply chain components like third-party libraries and infrastructure. Systematic benchmarks for supply chain vulnerabilities remain absent.

Method: Collected 3,859 real-world LLM applications through interdependency analysis, mapping 109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. Extracted fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance patterns. Identified 1,555 vulnerabilities from 4 categories using public databases.

Result: Discoveries include: 1) LLM applications exhibit deeply nested dependencies 2) Vulnerabilities exist at all supply chain tiers (models, datasets, libraries) with 1,229 library vulnerabilities alone 3) Data reuse and model fine-tuning paths amplify cascading effects.

Conclusion: The dataset establishes a critical benchmark for identifying systemic risks in LLM supply chains. Highlights the necessity for security frameworks addressing all components. Provides actionable recommendations for developing safer, more transparent systems.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment
of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate,
understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is
increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on
interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party
libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly
focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities.
While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there
remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.
  To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for
analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859
real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying
109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model
fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's
structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for
applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from
public vulnerability databases.
  Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks.
Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and
significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for
comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to
guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled
systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NoCode-bench benchmark reveals LLMs achieve only 15.79% success rate in natural language-driven no-code development tasks despite high token usage, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language-driven no-code development promises to increase productivity and democratize software creation. However, existing evaluations lack realistic documentation-based feature addition tasks, necessitating a benchmark like NoCode-bench to accurately assess LLM capabilities.

Method: Developed NoCode-bench with 634 tasks across 10 projects requiring 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with code implementations verified by developer test cases. A 114-task 'Verified' subset ensures reliable evaluation through human validation.

Result: Top LLMs achieved 15.79% task success rate. Challenges included cross-file editing (34% errors), incomplete codebase understanding (41% errors), and tool calling issues (25% errors) despite high token usage and documentation access.

Conclusion: LLMs are insufficiently prepared for real-world NL-driven no-code development due to persistent challenges in codebase comprehension and multi-file changes. NoCode-bench provides critical infrastructure for advancing this paradigm.

Abstract: Natural language-driven no-code development allows users to specify software
functionality using natural language (NL) instead of editing source code,
promising increased productivity and democratized development. Large language
models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context,
software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work
introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world
NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects
and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding
code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of
114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures
reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the
best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges
in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings
indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development.
NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality metadata for research software under FAIR principles is resource-intensive for researchers and engineers.

Method: Developed SMECS to integrate metadata extraction from online repositories (e.g., GitHub) with an interactive curation interface for exporting as CodeMeta files.

Result: Usability experiments confirmed SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience, facilitating efficient metadata curation.

Conclusion: SMECS reduces the burden of metadata creation, promoting the adoption of FAIR principles in research software through automation and accessibility.

Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in adopting the FAIR principles for research
software and enables findability and reusability. However, creating
high-quality metadata can be resource-intensive for researchers and research
software engineers. To address this challenge, we developed the Software
Metadata Extraction and Curation Software (SMECS) which integrates the
extraction of metadata from existing sources together with a user-friendly
interface for metadata curation. SMECS extracts metadata from online
repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an
interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The
usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed
that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the
FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a GenAI-driven framework for automating automotive ADAS software development, leveraging LLMs for requirements modeling, test scenario generation, and platform-specific code creation, with RAG enhancing regulatory compliance testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional automotive software development for ADAS systems faces long compliance and re-engineering cycles due to complex regulatory requirements and iterative design processes.

Method: A workflow integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is proposed, utilizing LLMs for Ecore metamodel/XMI model instantiation and OCL constraint creation, followed by test scenario generation for simulation code (Python) and hardware platform implementation (C++), augmented by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for test scenario construction from regulatory documents.

Result: Demonstrated reduction in compliance cycle duration, shortened re-engineering time, and accelerated ADAS development/testing via model-based LLM-generated test scenarios and platform code, though no quantitative metrics are provided.

Conclusion: The GenAI-empowered development approach proves effective in streamlining ADAS software creation through automated requirements processing, model-driven test generation, and regulatory alignment using RAG technology.

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

Motivation: The study addresses the critical need for a comprehensive understanding of EAIR system bugs to develop effective practices and techniques for their mitigation, which is currently lacking despite the rapid growth of EAIR technology.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic study by collecting and analyzing 885 bugs from 80 EAIR projects, classifying bugs into symptoms, underlying causes, and affected modules through comprehensive effort.

Result: The analysis reveals 15 symptoms (including 8 EAIR-specific ones characterized by functional failures and physical hazards), 18 underlying causes (8 EAIR-specific, mostly linked to AI-agent reasoning), and a mapping between 13 affected modules and their frequent bug causes.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundational framework for EAIR system bug analysis by providing cause-module correlations, enabling targeted diagnostic efforts and future research into EAIR-specific bug prevention and repair techniques.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly
evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is
fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth
understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the
development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs.
  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR
system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their
symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes
considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15
distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new
interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research
on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified
symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is
characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards.
Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the
majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and
decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction,
detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and
the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to
focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.

### [29] [Scheduzz: Constraint-based Fuzz Driver Generation with Dual Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18289)
*Yan Li,Wenzhang Yang,Yuekun Wang,Jian Gao,Shaohua Wang,Yinxing Xue,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Scheduzz is an LLM-based library fuzzing technique that uses a dual scheduling framework to optimize fuzz driver generation and execution, significantly improving coverage and bug discovery while reducing computational overhead compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually crafting fuzz drivers for libraries is challenging and error-prone, while existing automated methods generate inefficient, irrational drivers that waste resources and produce false positives. Proper adherence to library usage conventions (e.g., resource opening/closing) remains a critical issue.

Method: Scheduzz employs large language models (LLMs) to analyze library documentation and extract API usage constraints (e.g., call order, parameter dependencies). It implements a dual scheduling framework: (1) a generator that creates fuzz drivers by solving an online optimization problem to select valid API combinations, and (2) an executor that dynamically schedules drivers for execution or suspension based on resource utilization and coverage metrics.

Result: Scheduzz evaluated on 33 real-world libraries showed: 16/21 libraries outperformed UTopia, 1.62x-1.89x higher coverage than state-of-the-art techniques, and discovery of 33 previously unknown bugs (3 with CVE assignments).

Conclusion: Scheduzz addresses automated library fuzzing shortcomings by combining LLM-driven API constraint analysis with a dual scheduling framework, achieving resource efficiency and improved coverage over existing solutions. The method demonstrates the potential of LLMs to learn and enforce proper library usage patterns in security testing.

Abstract: Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and
craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many
techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However,
they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to
proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after
being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques
unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers
that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and
generating false positive bug reports.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing
technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs
to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination
constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling
framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz
drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing
campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,
multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while
simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or
suspension.
  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared
to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead
and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and
1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer,
Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition,
Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries,
3 of which have been assigned CVEs.

### [30] [YATE: The Role of Test Repair in LLM-Based Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18316)
*Michael Konstantinou,Renzo Degiovanni,Jie M. Zhang,Mark Harman,Mike Papadakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes YATE, a technique that combines rule-based static analysis and re-prompting to repair incorrect tests generated by language models, achieving significant improvements in code coverage and mutation killing over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models for automated test generation produce many syntactically and semantically incorrect tests, which represent a missed opportunity as they could be valuable once fixed and serve as good seeds for additional test generation.

Method: The approach integrates rule-based static analysis to identify and correct test errors with re-prompting strategies to refine test outputs, systematically repairing invalid tests while maintaining their logical relevance to the target code.

Result: Evaluations on six open-source projects show YATE achieves 32.06% more line coverage and 21.77% more mutant kills than plain LLM methods. Compared to HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK, and COVERUP, YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage, and kills 20% more mutants with similar computational costs.

Conclusion: YATE demonstrates that test repair through static analysis and iterative prompting significantly enhances the effectiveness of LLM-generated tests, offering both direct quality improvements and indirect benefits for downstream test generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to
produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many
incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such
incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed
opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing
value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and
indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we
propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through
a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this
simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that
it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and
kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE
with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and
COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code.
YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20%
more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).

### [31] [Gotta catch 'em all! Towards File Localisation from Issues at Large](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18319)
*Jesse Maarleveld,Jiapan Guo,Daniel Feitosa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data pipeline for creating issue file localization datasets without restricting to specific issue types or selection methods. It evaluates traditional IR approaches and reveals performance challenges with general-purpose models, showing bug-specific methods underperform, statistically significant differences between issue types, and project-dependent results encouraging tailored methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on file localisation primarily focuses on bugs or uses selection methods to restrict issue types, whereas this paper aims to study all issues broadly without such biases, expanding the scope of file localisation beyond just bugs.

Method: A data pipeline was developed to create file localisation datasets that handle arbitrary branching and merging practices. Baseline performance using traditional information retrieval (IR) approaches was evaluated. Statistical analysis was conducted to investigate biases from the bug localisation community in the dataset.

Result: Bug-specific heuristics perform poorly on general issue types. Minor but statistically significant performance differences exist between issue types. Identifiers have a small effect across most issue types. Project dependencies exist, requiring customization for project-specific characteristics.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for general-purpose models that outperform bug-specific methods and emphasizes project-dependent adaptations for file localisation tasks, advancing research beyond bug-focused approaches.

Abstract: Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files
requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to
develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are
starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing
research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other
selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part
of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without
any specific selection.
  In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file
localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging
practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file
localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches.
Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases
known in the bug localisation community on our dataset.
  Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform
poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general
purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically
significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally,
we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for
most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the
development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.

### [32] [FMI Meets SystemC: A Framework for Cross-Tool Virtual Prototyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18339)
*Nils Bosbach,Meik Schmidt,Lukas J√ºnger,Matthias Berthold,Rainer Leupers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to integrate SystemC TLM-based Virtual Platforms with the FMI standard for co-simulation, enabling realistic software testing without physical hardware. It demonstrates this via a temperature sensor case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SystemC TLM's lack of native FMI support limits integration with broader co-simulation environments, hindering thorough testing of control software in complex systems before physical hardware availability.

Method: Developed a novel framework to interface FMI-compatible tools with SystemC simulations. Implemented a case study where a simulated temperature sensor receives data from an external tool using this framework, without modifying target software.

Result: Enabled execution of unmodified target software on VPs with realistic environmental inputs (e.g., temperature) from external tools. Improved pre-hardware testing efficiency, allowing earlier ISO 26262 certifications when physical hardware becomes available.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges SystemC TLM and FMI for co-simulation, enhancing software verification capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing development practices (e.g., using unmodified software) and certification standards.

Abstract: As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual
prototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed
to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the
environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface
(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.
  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a
System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software
from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software
without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the
so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized
framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and
concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks
native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation
environments.
  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with
SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a
simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature
values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified
target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data
such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,
extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready
and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,
certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.

### [33] [Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476)
*Busra Icoz,Goksel Biricik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid approach combining symbolic reasoning techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate code review, addressing the limitations of LLMs in logical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual code review is subjective and time-consuming, while existing AI-based methods, particularly LLMs, lack the necessary logical reasoning capabilities to fully understand and evaluate code effectively.

Method: The study integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs (e.g., CodeT5, CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT) using a hybrid approach. This combination is tested on the CodexGlue dataset to evaluate its performance.

Result: The hybrid approach demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency in automated code review compared to individual models.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic reasoning with LLMs enhances the effectiveness of automated code review, offering a robust solution to the limitations of purely AI-based approaches.

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

### [34] [A Deep Dive into Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Code Completion: Experience on WeChat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18515)
*Zezhou Yang,Ting Peng,Cuiyun Gao,Chaozheng Wang,Hailiang Huang,Yuetang Deng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for code completion in closed-source industrial codebases (WeChat's internal repositories). They compare identifier-based and similarity-based RAG across 26 LLMs, find similarity-based RAG with combined lexical (BM25) and semantic (GTE-Qwen) retrieval achieves optimal performance, and validate practical utility via developer surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RAG methods have shown success in open-source code completion, the distribution shift between open-source and proprietary/industrial-scale codebases introduces unexplored challenges. This study addresses the lack of empirical evaluations in closed-source contexts like WeChat's codebase.

Method: The authors test two RAG paradigms (identifier-based and similarity-based) across 26 open-source LLMs (0.5B-671B parameters) using WeChat's 1,669 internal repositories. For similarity-based RAG, they compare lexical retrieval (BM25), semantic retrieval (GTE-Qwen), and their combination through empirical evaluation.

Result: Key results include: (1) similarity-based RAG outperforms identifier-based RAG in closed-source settings, (2) advanced retrieval techniques significantly improve similarity-based RAG with BM25 and GTE-Qwen showing top performance, (3) hybrid lexical+semantic retrieval achieves best results, and (4) developer surveys confirm practical utility.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that similarity-based RAG with complementary lexical-semantic retrieval techniques is particularly effective for industrial-scale code completion tasks. The findings highlight the importance of adapting RAG methods to proprietary codebases and suggest directions for domain-specific code completion strategies.

Abstract: Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances
developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid
advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to
enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant
context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and
benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and
closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To
mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance
of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase
of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we
extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG
and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B
parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval
techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.
Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both
RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with
similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of
similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where
BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior
performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval
techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.
Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of
RAG methods in real-world development environments.
