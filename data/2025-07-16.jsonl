Second, we identify\nand experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across\ntimesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias\nand inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps.

Based on these\ninsights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism\ncomprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency\npoison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid\nadversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain\nlearning to relevant regions.

Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize\nattack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect\nremains between theory and practical implementation.\n  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to\nbridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into\nreal-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and\ncoordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge\nclassical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static\npayoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational\nrealities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel\nsolution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now\nbe modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.\n  This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and\ncybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic,\nBayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts.

Just-in-time vulnerability prediction (JIT-VP)\nis a proactive approach to identifying vulnerable commits and providing early\nwarnings about potential security risks. However, we observe that current\nJIT-VP evaluations rely on an idealized setting, where the evaluation datasets\nare artificially balanced, consisting exclusively of vulnerability-introducing\nand vulnerability-fixing commits.\n  To address this limitation, this study assesses the effectiveness of JIT-VP\ntechniques under a more realistic setting that includes both\nvulnerability-related and vulnerability-neutral commits. To enable a reliable\nevaluation, we introduce a large-scale public dataset comprising over one\nmillion commits from FFmpeg and the Linux kernel. Our empirical analysis of\neight state-of-the-art JIT-VP techniques reveals a significant decline in\npredictive performance when applied to real-world conditions; for example, the\naverage PR-AUC on Linux drops 98\\% from 0.805 to 0.016. This discrepancy is\nmainly attributed to the severe class imbalance in real-world datasets, where\nvulnerability-introducing commits constitute only a small fraction of all\ncommits.\n  To mitigate this issue, we explore the effectiveness of widely adopted\ntechniques for handling dataset imbalance, including customized loss functions,\noversampling, and undersampling. Surprisingly, our experimental results\nindicate that these techniques are ineffective in addressing the imbalance\nproblem in JIT-VP. These findings underscore the importance of realistic\nevaluations of JIT-VP and the need for domain-specific techniques to address\ndata imbalance in such scenarios."}

While large language models\n(LLMs) offer potential for automating advisory tasks, most existing solutions\nremain limited to prototypes or synthetic benchmarks. MARAUS addresses this gap\nby combining hybrid retrieval, multi-agent orchestration, and LLM-based\ngeneration into a system tailored for real-world university admissions. In\ncollaboration with the University of Transport Technology (UTT) in Hanoi, we\nconducted a two-phase study involving technical development and real-world\nevaluation. MARAUS processed over 6,000 actual user interactions, spanning six\ncategories of queries. Results show substantial improvements over LLM-only\nbaselines: on average 92 percent accuracy, hallucination rates reduced from 15\nprecent to 1.45 percent, and average response times below 4 seconds. The system\noperated cost-effectively, with a two-week deployment cost of 11.58 USD using\nGPT-4o mini.

Although tools like ReExtractor+,\nRefactoringMiner, and RefDiff have been developed to detect refactorings\nautomatically, they rely on complex rule definitions and static analysis,\nmaking them difficult to extend and generalize to other programming languages.\nIn this paper, we investigate the viability of using foundation models for\nrefactoring detection, implemented in a tool named RefModel. We evaluate\nPhi4-14B, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on a dataset of 858 single-operation\ntransformations applied to artificially generated Java programs, covering\nwidely-used refactoring types. We also extend our evaluation by including\nGemini 2.5 Pro and o4-mini-high, assessing their performance on 44 real-world\nrefactorings extracted from four open-source projects. These models are\ncompared against RefactoringMiner, RefDiff, and ReExtractor+. RefModel is\ncompetitive with, and in some cases outperform, traditional tools. In\nreal-world settings, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro jointly identified\n97% of all refactorings, surpassing the best-performing static-analysis-based\ntools. The models showed encouraging generalization to Python and Golang. They\nprovide natural language explanations and require only a single sentence to\ndefine each refactoring type."}

However, their susceptibility to misuse has raised significant\nsafety concerns. While post-training safety alignment methods have been widely\nadopted, LLMs remain vulnerable to malicious instructions that can bypass\nsafety constraints. Recent efforts have introduced inference-time safety\nreasoning (system-2 alignment), where LLMs conduct a reasoning process to\nperform safety verification before final response. We show, however, that these\nchecks are driven by ad-hoc reasoning that diverges from the structured human\nprocess, where they first discern a user's true intent, then evaluate the\nassociated risk based on the true intent. Consequently, these defenses remain\nvulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak prompts that cloak harmful goals in\nseemingly benign language. To build secure and safe LLMs, we propose a\nreasoning-based safety alignment framework, ARMOR, that replaces the ad-hoc\nchains of thought reasoning process with human-aligned, structured one. At\ninference, ARMOR (1) detects likely jailbreak strategies, (2) extracts the\nuser's core intent while discarding deceptive instructions, and (3) applies a\npolicy-grounded safety analysis to the purified request. ARMOR is evaluated on\nadaptive jailbreak attacks and multiple safety benchmarks, and a test-time\nscaling is conducted to further improve its performance. Results demonstrate\nthat ARMOR significantly enhances the robustness against state-of-the-art\nadaptive jailbreak attacks and outperforms recent reasoning-based aligned\nmodels across various safety benchmarks."}

When not handled properly, these\nconstraints cause unaddressed security vulnerabilities to accumulate over time,\nforming Security Debts (SDs). Despite their critical importance, there is\nlimited empirical evidence on how software practitioners perceive, manage, and\ncommunicate SDs in real-world settings. In this paper, we present a qualitative\nempirical study based on semi-structured interviews with 22 software\npractitioners across various roles, organizations, and countries. We address\nfour research questions: i) we assess software practitioners' knowledge of SDs\nand awareness of associated security risks, ii) we investigate their behavior\ntowards SDs, iii) we explore common tools and strategies used to mitigate SDs,\nand iv) we analyze how security risks are communicated within teams and to\ndecision makers. We observe variations in how practitioners perceive and manage\nSDs, with some prioritizing delivery speed over security, while others\nconsistently maintain security as a priority. Our findings emphasize the need\nfor stronger integration of security practices across the Software Development\nLife Cycle (SDLC), more consistent use of mitigation strategies, better\nbalancing of deadlines, resources, and security-related tasks, with attention\nto the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad."}

Ideally, collaborative fuzzing\nshould be a more promising direction toward generic fuzzing solutions, as it\nmitigates the need for manual cherry-picking of individual fuzzers.
