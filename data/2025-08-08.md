### [1] [Adversarial Attacks and Defenses on Graph-aware Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04894)
*Iyiola E. Olatunji,Franziska Boenisch,Jing Xu,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores adversarial vulnerabilities in graph-aware LLMs (LLAGA/GRAPHPROMPTER), identifies exploitable design weaknesses, and proposes GALGUARD as an end-to-end defense framework combining LLM feature correction and GNN-based protections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examines robustness of emerging graph-LLM integration against adversarial attacks while addressing: 1) Untapped vulnerabilities in LLAGA's node template 2) Comparative robustness of GNN-based GRAPHPROMPTER 3) Persistence of feature perturbation risks across both models.

Method: Conducted systematic analysis using established poisoning/evasion attacks on LLAGA/GRAPHPROMPTER, discovered new placeholder node injection attack, and implemented hybrid defense strategy with LLM corrections and adapted GNN defenses.

Result: Three key findings: 1) LLAGA's node sequence template design increases attack success 2) GNN encoder in GRAPHPROMPTER provides better structural robustness 3) Both models vulnerable to imperceptible feature attacks. GALGUARD mitigates all these risks.

Conclusion: Highlights critical security gaps in graph-LLM systems showing design choices significantly impact robustness. GALGUARD demonstrates viability of hybrid defense approaches for protecting these emerging architectures against multiple attack vectors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with
graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain
traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration
leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their
robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first
step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing
adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for
poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two
representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al.
2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an
attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence
template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals
that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with
specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its
vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater
robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature
perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework
GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate
feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against
structural attacks.

### [2] [On the Classical Hardness of the Semidirect Discrete Logarithm Problem in Finite Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05048)
*Mohammad Ferry Husnil Arif,Muhammad Imran*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the classical computational hardness of the semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) across finite group platforms. The findings show that SDLP's hardness is platform-dependent, not uniformly harder than standard DLP, and even vulnerable in elliptic curve groups due to bounded automorphisms. The study reveals that non-abelian structures alone do not guarantee classical security for cryptographic protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) was previously proposed as a post-quantum cryptography foundation due to its non-abelian nature, but recent quantum algorithms have weakened its perceived quantum resistance. The paper aims to assess whether SDLP offers better classical security against adversaries compared to traditional DLP in finite groups.

Method: The authors reformulate SDLP as a generalized discrete logarithm problem, enabling adaptation of classical algorithms. They apply and analyze the Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm for SDLP, deriving time/space complexity $O(\

Result: 1. SDLP reduces to generalized DLP, allowing classical algorithm adaptation. 2. In finite fields ($\mathbb{F}_p^*$$, SDLP and DLP have comparable complexity. 3. In elliptic curves ($E(\mathbb{F}_p)$$, SDLP becomes trivial via automorphism properties. 4. In elementary abelian groups ($\mathbb{F}_p^n$$, SDLP can be harder than DLP with eigenvalue-dependent complexity. 5. The hardness of SDLP is highly platform-specific, not inherently better than DLP.

Conclusion: Non-abelian group structures (e.g., semidirect products) do not inherently provide greater classical hardness for cryptographic problems. The paper emphasizes the need for careful evaluation of algebraic properties when selecting computational problems for secure cryptographic protocols.

Abstract: The semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) in finite groups was
proposed as a foundation for post-quantum cryptographic protocols, based on the
belief that its non-abelian structure would resist quantum attacks. However,
recent results have shown that SDLP in finite groups admits efficient quantum
algorithms, undermining its quantum resistance. This raises a fundamental
question: does the SDLP offer any computational advantages over the standard
discrete logarithm problem (DLP) against classical adversaries? In this work,
we investigate the classical hardness of SDLP across different finite group
platforms. We establish that the group-case SDLP can be reformulated as a
generalized discrete logarithm problem, enabling adaptation of classical
algorithms to study its complexity. We present a concrete adaptation of the
Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm for SDLP, achieving time and space complexity
$O(\sqrt{r})$ where $r$ is the period of the underlying cycle structure.
Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation in SageMath, we
demonstrate that the classical hardness of SDLP is highly platform-dependent
and does not uniformly exceed that of standard DLP. In finite fields
$\mathbb{F}_p^*$, both problems exhibit comparable complexity. Surprisingly, in
elliptic curves $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$, the SDLP becomes trivial due to the bounded
automorphism group, while in elementary abelian groups $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, the
SDLP can be harder than DLP, with complexity varying based on the eigenvalue
structure of the automorphism. Our findings reveal that the non-abelian
structure of semidirect products does not inherently guarantee increased
classical hardness, suggesting that the search for classically hard problems
for cryptographic applications requires more careful consideration of the
underlying algebraic structures.

### [3] [Incident Response Planning Using a Lightweight Large Language Model with Reduced Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05188)
*Kim Hammar,Tansu Alpcan,Emil C. Lupu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-step method (fine-tuning, information retrieval, lookahead planning) to reduce hallucinations in LLM-based incident response planning, achieving shorter recovery times and broader generalization compared to prompt-engineered frontier LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyberattacks are increasing, but selecting optimal response actions for complex systems is difficult. Existing LLM approaches rely on costly prompt engineering and suffer from hallucinations, limiting practical effectiveness.

Method: The method combines: (1) fine-tuning of LLMs to align with security knowledge; (2) information retrieval to contextualize incidents; and (3) lookahead planning to generate response steps with a rigorously bounded hallucination probability, minimized under assumptions of increased planning time.

Result: Evaluation on real-world incident logs shows: (a) 22% faster recovery times than frontier LLMs; (b) generalization across diverse incident types and response actions; (c) lightweight implementation on commodity hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a practical, less hallucinatory framework for LLM-based incident response planning that reduces recovery times and demonstrates broad applicability for complex systems.

Abstract: Timely and effective incident response is key to managing the growing
frequency of cyberattacks. However, identifying the right response actions for
complex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to
mitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large
language models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling.
Recent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current
methods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is
costly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting
a novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced
hallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information
retrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response
plans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can
be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under
certain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can
run on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents
reported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a)
achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes
to a broad range of incident types and response actions.

### [4] [An Overview of 7726 User Reports: Uncovering SMS Scams and Scammer Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05276)
*Sharad Agarwal,Guillermo Suarez-Tangil,Marie Vasek*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 1.35 million user reports of SMS messages, differentiating between spam and scams, with a focus on 12 scam types and infrastructure abuse by scammers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing firewalls fail to detect all malicious messages, and prior research has overlooked user-reported SMS that bypass these systems, creating a gap in understanding scam prevalence and tactics.

Method: Collaboration with a mobile network operator provided user reports; a framework classified 35.12% of unique texts as spam and 40.27% as scams, with analysis on scam types and infrastructure use.

Result: 89.16% of reports were texts, revealing high scam rates (40.27%). 'Wrong number' was the top scam type, and infrastructure like hosting services and mobile networks were exploited.

Conclusion: This pioneering study reveals scam dynamics in SMS traffic, emphasizing the need for improved detection tools and user awareness to combat evolving scam methods like 'wrong number' tactics.

Abstract: Mobile network operators implement firewalls to stop illicit messages, but
scammers find ways to evade detection. Previous work has looked into SMS texts
that are blocked by these firewalls. However, there is little insight into SMS
texts that bypass them and reach users. To this end, we collaborate with a
major mobile network operator to receive 1.35m user reports submitted over four
months. We find 89.16% of user reports comprise text messages, followed by
reports of suspicious calls and URLs. Using our methodological framework, we
identify 35.12% of the unique text messages reported by users as spam, while
40.27% are scam text messages. This is the first paper that investigates SMS
reports submitted by users and differentiates between spam and scams. Our paper
classifies the identified scam text messages into 12 scam types, of which the
most popular is 'wrong number' scams. We explore the various infrastructure
services that scammers abuse to conduct SMS scams, including mobile network
operators and hosting infrastructure, and analyze the text of the scam messages
to understand how scammers lure victims into providing them with their personal
or financial details.

role-based access for governments, regulators, institutions, and public
verifiers, allowing QR-based validation and on-chain revocation tracking. Our
prototype demonstrates enhanced trust, reduced verification time, and improved
international credibility for Bangladeshi degrees, promoting a more reliable
academic and employment ecosystem.

### [6] [Grouped k-threshold random grid-based visual cryptography scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05394)
*Xiaoli Zhuo,Xuehu Yan,Wei Yan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel hierarchical random grid-based visual cryptography scheme that achieves higher contrast in secret image sharing compared to existing methods, reaching the theoretical contrast upper bounds for the first time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current (k,n) random grid-based visual cryptography schemes (RGVCSs) fail to reach theoretical upper bounds for contrast, which directly impacts the visual quality of recovered images and creates a need for improved constructions.

Method: Proposes an n'-grouped (k,n) RGVCS paradigm that leverages arbitrary (k,n')-threshold schemes, establishes hierarchical contrast characteristics between groups, introduces a new contrast calculation formula, and presents a specific contrast-enhanced scheme by setting n'=k.

Result: The proposed scheme achieves the highest documented contrast value for (k,n) RGVCS, validated through theoretical analysis and experimental results showing its superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: The n'-grouped paradigm enables optimal intra-group contrast while maintaining hierarchical characteristics between groups, providing a significant advancement in RGVCS research.

Abstract: Visual cryptography schemes (VCSs) belong to a category of secret image
sharing schemes that do not require cryptographic knowledge for decryption,
instead relying directly on the human visual system. Among VCSs, random
grid-based VCS (RGVCS) has garnered widespread attention as it avoids pixel
expansion while requiring no basic matrices design. Contrast, a core metric for
RGVCS, directly determines the visual quality of recovered images, rendering
its optimization a critical research objective. However, existing $(k,n)$
RGVCSs still fail to attain theoretical upper bounds on contrast, highlighting
the urgent need for higher-contrast constructions. In this paper, we propose a
novel sharing paradigm for RGVCS that constructs $(k,n)$-threshold schemes from
arbitrary $(k,n')$-threshold schemes $(k \leq n'\leq n)$, termed
\emph{$n'$-grouped $(k,n)$ RGVCS}. This paradigm establishes hierarchical
contrast characteristics: participants within the same group achieve optimal
recovery quality, while inter-group recovery shows a hierarchical contrast. We
further introduce a new contrast calculation formula tailored to the new
paradigm. Then, we propose a contrast-enhanced $(k,n)$ RGVCS by setting $n'=
k$, achieving the highest contrast value documented in the existing literature.
Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our proposed scheme in terms of contrast.

### [7] [Local Distance Query with Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05518)
*Weihong Sheng,Jiajun Chen,Bin Cai,Chunqiang Hu,Meng Han,Jiguo Yu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes two methods for enabling differentially private distance queries under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) constraints when no central curator exists. The second method, specifically designed for distance queries, aggregates local distance vectors to capture global structure and outperforms synthetic graph approaches in utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional curator-based Differential Privacy (DP) relies on a centralized trusted entity holding complete graph data, but real-world scenarios often lack such a curator, making LDP distance queries challenging due to noise interference from decentralized data privacy mechanisms.

Method: First approach: Synthetic graph generation using randomized responses with bitwise operations to mitigate noise. Second approach (LDP-DQ): Novel decentralized method that continuously aggregates local privacy-preserving distance vectors from neighboring vertices to reconstruct accurate global distances through distributed computation.

Result: Theoretical analysis proves the method's privacy guarantees, and experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in query accuracy compared to synthetic graph approaches under similar privacy constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed LDP-DQ method effectively addresses decentralized distance query privacy challenges, achieving better utility than existing approaches while preserving differential privacy without requiring centralized data ownership.

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is commonly employed to safeguard graph analysis or
publishing. Distance, a critical factor in graph analysis, is typically handled
using curator DP, where a trusted curator holds the complete neighbor lists of
all vertices and answers queries privately. However, in many real-world
scenarios, such a curator may not be present, posing a significant challenge
for implementing differentially private distance queries under Local
Differential Privacy (LDP). This paper proposes two approaches to address this
challenge. The first approach generates a synthetic graph by randomizing
responses and applies bitwise operations to reduce noise interference. However,
like other synthetic graph methods, this approach suffers from low utility. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a second approach, the first LDP method
specifically designed for distance queries, which captures the global graph
structure by continuously aggregating local distance vectors from neighboring
vertices. This process enables the accurate updating of global distances. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive theoretical
analysis and experimental evaluations on real-world datasets.

### [8] [PRvL: Quantifying the Capabilities and Risks of Large Language Models for PII Redaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05545)
*Leon Garza,Anantaa Kotal,Aritran Piplai,Lavanya Elluri,Prajit Das,Aman Chadha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for PII redaction, evaluating architectural and training choices to provide practical guidance on accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware configurations. It introduces PRvL, an open-source PII redaction framework based on open-source LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rule-based systems and domain-specific NER models struggle with generalizing PII redaction across diverse formats and contexts. While LLMs show promise through contextual language understanding, the impact of architectural and training decisions on redaction performance remains poorly understood.

Method: The study evaluates multiple LLM architectures and training strategies for PII redaction, analyzing their effectiveness using metrics including redaction performance, semantic preservation, PII leakage, latency, and computational cost. Empirical comparisons are conducted to assess tradeoffs between these factors.

Result: Results demonstrate key insights into configuring LLM-based redaction systems that balance accuracy, efficiency, and privacy awareness, showing how architectural choices and training approaches impact these critical performance dimensions.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that careful architectural and training decisions enable LLMs to become effective contextual privacy learners for PII redaction. PRvL provides a customizable, open-source solution enabling secure, self-managed PII redaction across domains without third-party infrastructure.

Abstract: Redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from unstructured text is
critical for ensuring data privacy in regulated domains. While earlier
approaches have relied on rule-based systems and domain-specific Named Entity
Recognition (NER) models, these methods fail to generalize across formats and
contexts. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising
alternative, yet the effect of architectural and training choices on redaction
performance remains underexplored. LLMs have demonstrated strong performance in
tasks that require contextual language understanding, including the redaction
of PII in free-form text. Prior work suggests that with appropriate adaptation,
LLMs can become effective contextual privacy learners. However, the
consequences of architectural and training choices for PII Redaction remain
underexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of LLMs as
privacy-preserving PII Redaction systems. We evaluate a range of LLM
architectures and training strategies for their effectiveness in PII Redaction.
Our analysis measures redaction performance, semantic preservation, and PII
leakage, and compares these outcomes against latency and computational cost.
The results provide practical guidance for configuring LLM-based redactors that
are accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware. To support reproducibility and
real-world deployment, we release PRvL, an open-source suite of fine-tuned
models, and evaluation tools for general-purpose PII Redaction. PRvL is built
entirely on open-source LLMs and supports multiple inference settings for
flexibility and compliance. It is designed to be easily customized for
different domains and fully operable within secure, self-managed environments.
This enables data owners to perform redactions without relying on third-party
services or exposing sensitive content beyond their own infrastructure.

### [9] [Automated File-Level Logging Generation for Machine Learning Applications using LLMs: A Case Study using GPT-4o Mini](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04820)
*Mayra Sofia Ruiz Rodriguez,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates GPT-4o mini's ability to generate file-level logs for ML projects, finding it places logs in correct locations 63.91% of the time but suffers from 82.66% overlogging due to challenges like log placement in function boundaries, handling large code blocks, and aligning with project conventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research on LLM-based logging focuses only on function-level logs, neglecting file-level logging which is critical for ML application reliability. This creates a gap in understanding logging at larger code scopes.

Method: 1) Collected 171 ML repos with 4,073 Python files containing logs 2) Removed original logs 3) Prompted LLM to regenerate logs 4) Evaluated position accuracy, log level appropriateness, variable usage, and text quality through automated metrics and manual analysis of a representative sample.

Result: LLM matches human log positions in 63.91% of files but has 82.66% overlogging rate. Manual analysis reveals issues with logging at function boundaries, within large code blocks, and adherence to project-specific conventions. Log level, variable selection, and message quality show mixed results.

Conclusion: While LLMs demonstrate potential for file-level logging in ML projects, overlogging and alignment with project standards remain significant challenges. Practical implementation requires addressing these limitations before adoption can be justified.

Abstract: Logging is essential in software development, helping developers monitor
system behavior and aiding in debugging applications. Given the ability of
large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers
are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work
focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log
generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications,
where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate
the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML
projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing
4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed
the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them,
and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text
quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we
manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common
patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place
as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of
82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level
logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function,
difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with
project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for
generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed
for practical implementation.

### [10] [Automated Bug Frame Retrieval from Gameplay Videos Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04895)
*Wentao Lu,Alexander Senchenko,Abram Hindle,Cor-Paul Bezemer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: An automated pipeline selects a single frame from gameplay videos that best matches a bug description, aiding developers in quickly verifying bug reports without watching entire videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Game studios generate thousands of bug reports with gameplay videos, requiring developers to manually watch each video for triage, which is labor-intensive, slow, and hard to scale.

Method: The pipeline uses FFmpeg to extract keyframes (1.90% of original frames, capturing 98.79% of bug moments) followed by a vision-language model (GPT-4o) ranking keyframes against the textual bug description to select the most representative frame.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.79 and accuracy of 0.89 for top-1 frame selection. Highest performance in Lighting & Shadow (F1=0.94), Physics & Collision (0.86), and UI & HUD (0.83) categories, with lowest in Animation & VFX (0.51).

Conclusion: The approach reduces manual effort and accelerates bug triage and regression checks, offering scalable and practical benefits for game industry QA teams and developers.

Abstract: Modern game studios deliver new builds and patches at a rapid pace,
generating thousands of bug reports, many of which embed gameplay videos. To
verify and triage these bug reports, developers must watch the submitted
videos. This manual review is labour-intensive, slow, and hard to scale. In
this paper, we introduce an automated pipeline that reduces each video to a
single frame that best matches the reported bug description, giving developers
instant visual evidence that pinpoints the bug.
  Our pipeline begins with FFmpeg for keyframe extraction, reducing each video
to a median of just 1.90% of its original frames while still capturing bug
moments in 98.79 of cases. These keyframes are then evaluated by a
vision--language model (GPT-4o), which ranks them based on how well they match
the textual bug description and selects the most representative frame. We
evaluated this approach using real-world developer-submitted gameplay videos
and JIRA bug reports from a popular First-Person Shooter (FPS) game. The
pipeline achieves an overall F1 score of 0.79 and Accuracy of 0.89 for the
top-1 retrieved frame. Performance is highest for the Lighting & Shadow (F1 =
0.94), Physics & Collision (0.86), and UI & HUD (0.83) bug categories, and
lowest for Animation & VFX (0.51).
  By replacing video viewing with an immediately informative image, our
approach dramatically reduces manual effort and speeds up triage and regression
checks, offering practical benefits to quality assurance (QA) teams and
developers across the game industry.

*Zixuan Feng,Reed Milewicz,Emerson Murphy-Hill,Tyler Menezes,Alexander Serebrenik,Igor Steinmacher,Anita Sarma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores risks and opportunities for Open Source Software (OSS) communities amid Generative AI (GenAI) disruption, using a socio-technical framework across software practices, documentation, engagement, and governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OSS communities lack frameworks to address GenAI's transformative and ambiguous impact, risking their collaborative ethos. Proactive analysis is needed to balance disruption and resilience.

Method: Scenario-driven conceptual exploration applying a socio-technical framework inspired by McLuhan's Tetrad, focusing on four domains: software development practices, documentation quality, community engagement dynamics, and governance structures.

Result: Identifies context-specific risks (e.g., governance conflicts) and opportunities (e.g., improved documentation workflows) for maintaining community resilience through structured analysis.

Conclusion: OSS leaders should adopt proactive socio-technical lenses to strategically navigate GenAI disruptions, shaping ecosystem trajectories rather than passively adapting to technological changes.

Abstract: Open Source Software communities face a wave of uncertainty as Generative AI
rapidly transforms how software is created, maintained, and governed. Without
clear frameworks, communities risk being overwhelmed by the complexity and
ambiguity introduced by GenAI, threatening the collaborative ethos that
underpins OSS. We conduct a scenario-driven, conceptual exploration using a
socio-technical framework inspired by McLuhan's Tetrad to surface both risks
and opportunities for community resilience amid GenAI-driven disruption of OSS
development across four domains: software practices, documentation, community
engagement, and governance. By adopting this lens, OSS leaders and researchers
can proactively shape the future of their ecosystems, rather than simply
reacting to technological upheaval.

### [12] [Taxonomy of Faults in Attention-Based Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04925)
*Sigma Jahan,Saurabh Singh Rajput,Tushar Sharma,Mohammad Masudur Rahman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel taxonomy of seven attention-specific fault categories in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs), identifying unique failure mechanisms and providing four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics to address gaps in deep learning fault analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning fault taxonomies fail to capture attention-specific failures, creating a void in actionable diagnostic guidance despite attention mechanisms' critical role in high-impact systems like ChatGPT and Google Gemini.

Method: Systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults from 96 projects across GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack Overflow within ten frameworks, focusing on attention-based neural networks.

Result: 55% of ABNN faults originate from attention-specific mechanisms; four diagnostic heuristics explain 33% of these attention-related faults, with root cause-symptom correlations validated through data analysis.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first systematic diagnostic framework for ABNNs, offering practitioners empirical taxonomy and heuristics to address the economic and technical challenges of attention mechanism failures.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering
systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major
economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical
outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention
weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault
taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by
attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable
diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work
is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96
projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack
Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven
attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results
show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to
attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations
of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root
cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that
explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic
diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.

*Gang Xu,Airong Wang,Yushan Pan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) workflows through stakeholder analysis of programmers, mariners, and experts, identifying integration points and evaluation methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have transformative applications across domains, yet their intersection with OOP remains understudied. Current research lacks understanding of how LLMs can improve OOP learning/code writing and how to evaluate these tools effectively.

Method: The authors analyze OOP task perspectives across three stakeholder groups (programmers, mariners, and experienced programmers), mapping critical coding workflow junctures where LLM integration might provide value and proposing augmentation strategies for logical reasoning and code writing.

Result: Identified key integration opportunities for LLMs in OOP workflows, proposed methods for enhancing code writing/learning through AI tools, and outlined potential benefits for different stakeholder perspectives.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for systematic exploration of LLM-OOP integration opportunities while emphasizing evaluation frameworks to measure effectiveness across stakeholder needs and workflow criticality.

Abstract: We find ourselves in the midst of an explosion in artificial intelligence
research, particularly with large language models (LLMs). These models have
diverse applications spanning finance, commonsense knowledge graphs, medicine,
and visual analysis. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), a robust
body of knowledge and methods has been developed for managing complex tasks
through object-oriented thinking. However, the intersection of LLMs with OOP
remains an underexplored territory. Empirically, we currently possess limited
understanding of how LLMs can enhance the effectiveness of OOP learning and
code writing, as well as how we can evaluate such AI-powered tools. Our work
aims to address this gap by presenting a vision from the perspectives of key
stakeholders involved in an OOP task: programmers, mariners, and experienced
programmers. We identify critical junctures within typical coding workflows
where the integration of LLMs can offer significant benefits. Furthermore, we
propose ways to augment existing logical reasoning and code writing, ultimately
enhancing the programming experience.

### [14] [An ML-based Approach to Predicting Software Change Dependencies: Insights from an Empirical Study on OpenStack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05034)
*Arabat,Ali,Sayagh,Mohammed,Hassine,Jameleddine*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study on OpenStack highlights challenges in managing interdependent software changes, reveals most dependencies are identified post-commit during code reviews with significant delays, and proposes a dual ML model approach to enhance proactive dependency management, showing robust performance metrics. Developers spend considerable time identifying dependencies manually.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern software systems exhibit complex, cross-team dependencies, leading to inefficiencies in CI/CD pipelines through delayed detection and manual effort. Accurate dependency management is crucial for stability and deployment efficiency.

Method: A semi-automated approach using two ML models: one predicts dependency likelihood, while the other identifies specific dependent change pairs by analyzing historical OpenStack data.

Result: 51.08% of dependencies identified post-commit during code reviews after 5.06-hour delay. Models achieved AUC 79.33% (likelihood prediction) and 91.89% (pair identification), with Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014. High top-k recall confirmed effectiveness.

Conclusion: The dual ML model approach demonstrates potential to reduce manual dependency identification in large-scale systems, though top-k precision remains suboptimal. Post-commit dependency detection patterns in OpenStack emphasize the need for proactive tools.

Abstract: As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing
dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a
change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it.
Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate
changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature
deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple
components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.
They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing
configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like
documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary
study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our
study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over
the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these
dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay
of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often
spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a
median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify
dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML
models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes,
while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed
models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33%
and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the
second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k
precision has room for improvement.

### [15] [LadyBug: A GitHub Bot for UI-Enhanced Bug Localization in Mobile Apps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05085)
*Junayed Mahmud,James Chen,Terry Achille,Camilo Alvarez-Velez,Darren Dean Bansil,Patrick Ijieh,Samar Karanch,Nadeeshan De Silva,Oscar Chaparro,Andrian Marcus,Kevin Moran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LadyBug is a GitHub bot for Android apps that combines UI interaction data and text retrieval to automatically localize bugs, demonstrating improved accuracy over text-based methods using its RedWing evaluation benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-retrieval-based bug localization methods for Android apps often lack precision due to incomplete context from bug descriptions alone, necessitating a solution that integrates UI interaction data for more accurate fault localization.

Method: The system utilizes both textual analysis of bug reports and captures device/emulator UI interaction traces (like screen navigation and user inputs) uploaded via GitHub issues to generate a ranked list of files containing the bug.

Result: Empirical results using the RedWing benchmark (80 bugs from 39 Android apps) show LadyBug outperforms text-based baselines by 56.3% and achieves an accuracy of 68.4% where the actual buggy file ranks in the top 3

Conclusion: The integration of UI interaction data with text analysis significantly enhances bug localization accuracy for Android apps, as demonstrated by LadyBug's open-source tool and rigorous experimental validation

Abstract: This paper introduces LadyBug, a GitHub bot that automatically localizes bugs
for Android apps by combining UI interaction information with text retrieval.
LadyBug connects to an Android app's GitHub repository, and is triggered when a
bug is reported in the corresponding issue tracker. Developers can then record
a reproduction trace for the bug on a device or emulator and upload the trace
to LadyBug via the GitHub issue tracker. This enables LadyBug to utilize both
the text from the original bug description, and UI information from the
reproduction trace to accurately retrieve a ranked list of files from the
project that most likely contain the reported bug.
  We empirically evaluated LadyBug using an automated testing pipeline and
benchmark called RedWing that contains 80 fully-localized and reproducible bug
reports from 39 Android apps. Our results illustrate that LadyBug outperforms
text-retrieval-based baselines and that the utilization of UI information leads
to a substantial increase in localization accuracy. LadyBug is an open-source
tool, available at https://github.com/LadyBugML/ladybug.

### [16] [Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170)
*Lishui Fan,Yu Zhang,Mouxiang Chen,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework combining reasoning process evaluation and task-success conditional RL (P-GRPO) to improve code generation in LLMs, achieving a 4.5% performance boost over existing methods while avoiding reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based code generation for LLMs focuses solely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, ignoring reasoning process quality and leading to reward hacking where models optimize for shallow rewards without improving actual results.

Method: The approach includes three components: (1) LCB-RB, a reasoning benchmark with preference pairs; (2) an OD-based reward model training method that systematically evaluates reasoning quality across factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence; (3) P-GRPO, an RL framework that applies process-based rewards only to successful task outcomes to prevent exploitation of reward signals.

Result: A 7B reward model using OD-based training achieves SOTA on LCB-RB with strong generalization. P-GRPO improves code generation by 4.5% over outcome-only baselines and performs comparably to GPT-4-Turbo. The method generalizes to mathematical reasoning tasks as well.

Conclusion: By aligning intermediate reasoning quality with final task success through P-GRPO, the framework mitigates reward hacking in code generation. The combination of a purpose-built benchmark, OD-based reward models, and conditional process-based RL demonstrates a robust solution to improve code generation performance while maintaining reasoning quality.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for
large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based
rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning
process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising
direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model
learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.
To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively
incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable
reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference
pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score
reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method
for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs
by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along
curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical
rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other
benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method
that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying
rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO
effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning
with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior
performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only
baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further
demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to
mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.

### [17] [AI-assisted JSON Schema Creation and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05192)
*Felix Neubauer,Jürgen Pleiss,Benjamin Uekermann*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid approach using LLMs and deterministic techniques for JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping via natural language inputs, integrated into the open-source MetaConfigurator tool to lower data modeling barriers for non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many research domains lack standardized models, and current data modeling remains challenging for non-experts due to the need for manual schema creation and integration.

Method: Combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic techniques to process natural language inputs for automating JSON Schema creation/editing and generating schema mappings between heterogeneous data formats (JSON, CSV, XML, YAML) using the MetaConfigurator tool.

Result: Demonstrated the tool's ability to generate schema mappings and lower modeling barriers through an application example in chemistry, achieving scalability/reliability via deterministic execution of generated rules.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach integrates LLMs' flexibility with deterministic safeguards, enabling non-experts to perform structured data modeling and integration tasks more effectively and reducing reliance on domain expertise for schema creation.

Abstract: Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) places models at the core of system and data
engineering processes. In the context of research data, these models are
typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of
datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating
them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a
hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic
techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping
based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated
into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model
editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data
integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and
YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through
deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our
work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By
combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work
significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data
integration for non-experts.

### [18] [STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench: Evaluating Complex Multi-Function Comprehension and Fine-Grained Execution Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05193)
*Kaiwen Yan,Yuhang Chang,Zirui Guo,Yaling Mou,Jiang Ming,Jingwei Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark for evaluating advanced code reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond single-function correctness, focusing on complex multi-function understanding and step-level execution reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP) prioritize functional correctness and simple reasoning, while CRUXEVAL is limited to low-complexity single-function tasks. This results in saturated scores for advanced models, reducing the ability to distinguish their true capabilities in complex code reasoning scenarios.

Method: SX-Bench uses tasks requiring multi-function collaboration (e.g., chained calls, nested loops) and defines 'computation steps' as the smallest unit of execution reasoning. Models must predict the total number of steps in a task, exceeding baseline I/O matching evaluations. An automated pipeline combining program synthesis, symbolic execution, and LLM validation was developed for benchmark generation.

Result: Evaluation across 20+ modern models (including 14 reasoning-focused ones) shows SX-Bench's strong discriminative ability. State-of-the-art model OpenAI-O3 reaches only 78.37% accuracy on hard reasoning tasks, indicating code reasoning remains a significant challenge compared to prior benchmarks.

Conclusion: SX-Bench shifts code evaluation from 'single-function verification' to detailed 'multi-function dynamic reasoning' assessment. It provides a critical tool for measuring the depth of advanced code intelligence models in execution-level understanding.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in code intelligence, yet systematically evaluating their code understanding
and reasoning abilities remains challenging. Mainstream benchmarks such as
HumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning
benchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity
scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores,
limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present
STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex
multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench
features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g.,
chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and
data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution
unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning
tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution
beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including
14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly
discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent
accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on
previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained
reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis,
symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation
and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function
verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for
the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.

*Igor Costa,Christopher Baran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EvoGraph is a self-evolving software framework using specialized small language models (SLMs) to modernize legacy systems. It achieves 83% security fix rates, 93% functional equivalence between COBOL and Java, and reduces modernization costs by 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in legacy code modernization including implicit contracts, performance preservation, and integration evolution, which traditional methods often fail to handle effectively.

Method: EvoGraph uses typed directed graphs to represent software artefacts, applies learned mutation operators via language-specific SLMs, and employs multi-objective fitness selection to continuously evolve codebases while maintaining control.

Result: Experiments show EvoGraph fixes 83% of vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93% test-verified equivalence, reduces latency by 40%, and lowers computational costs by 90% compared to large language models. Semantic equivalence of 82-96% is achieved across 7+ languages.

Conclusion: EvoGraph demonstrates a practical path toward Software 3.0 by enabling controlled, continuous system adaptation. It effectively tackles empirical failure modes in legacy modernization while providing measurable improvements in quality and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce **EvoGraph**, a framework that enables software systems to
evolve their own source code, build pipelines, documentation, and tickets.
EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned
mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and
selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph
fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93%
functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness
within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold
drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our
approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing
.NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96%
semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90%
compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical
failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance
preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path
toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under
measurable control.

*Victoria Torres Bosch,Ronny Seiger,Manuela Albert Albiol,Antoni Mestre Gascon,Pedro Jose Valderas Aranda*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Proposes a conceptual model and methodology to integrate IoT with BPM for sustainability across environmental, social, and economic dimensions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BPM sustainability research primarily focuses on environmental concerns, neglecting a holistic approach to address all three dimensions of sustainability

Method: Developed a conceptual model linking BPM and IoT, and a structured methodology for analyzing and implementing sustainability-aware IoT-enhanced BPs

Result: Illustrated through a tourism domain example and healthcare case study, demonstrating IoT's role in enhancing BP sustainability across multiple dimensions

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables systematic integration of IoT in BPs to measure and improve sustainability, achieving lasting impact beyond environmental focus

Abstract: The real-time data collection and automation capabilities offered by the
Internet of Things (IoT) are revolutionizing and transforming Business
Processes (BPs) into IoT-enhanced BPs, showing high potential for improving
sustainability. Although already studied in Business Process Management (BPM),
sustainability research has primarily focused on environmental concerns.
However, achieving a holistic and lasting impact requires a systematic approach
to address sustainability beyond the environmental dimension. This work
proposes a conceptual model and a structured methodology with the goal of
analyzing the potential of IoT to measure and improve the sustainability of
BPs. The conceptual model formally represents key sustainability concepts,
linking BPM and IoT by highlighting how IoT devices support and contribute to
sustainability. The methodology guides the systematic analysis of existing BPs,
identifies opportunities, and implements sustainability-aware, IoT-enhanced
BPs. The approach is illustrated through a running example from the tourism
domain and a case study in healthcare.
