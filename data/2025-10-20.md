Motivation: Digital financial systems face security/privacy risks from centralized traditional ML methods in IoT-enabled environments (ATMs/POS). FL offers decentralized model training that preserves privacy, but its deployment in finance remains challenged by data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks, and regulatory compliance.

Method: Survey of FL applications in finance with a novel classification system based on regulatory exposure levels (low: collaborative portfolio optimization vs. high: real-time fraud detection). Reviews existing defense mechanisms and evaluates FL's practical implementation versus theoretical surveys.

Result: FL demonstrates promise in fraud prevention, portfolio optimization, and blockchain integration while addressing regulatory needs. Challenges include data variability, security threats, and compliance complexity. Current defenses and emerging solutions (differential privacy) are mapped for future development.

Conclusion: This paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers, highlighting Federated Learning's (FL) potential to advance secure, privacy-compliant financial systems. It maps practical FL applications, identifies deployment challenges (e.g., data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks), and proposes future directions like blockchain integration and quantum-secure frameworks.

Abstract: With the growth of digital financial systems, robust security and privacy
have become a concern for financial institutions. Even though traditional
machine learning models have shown to be effective in fraud detections, they
often compromise user data by requiring centralized access to sensitive
information. In IoT-enabled financial endpoints such as ATMs and POS Systems
that regularly produce sensitive data that is sent over the network. Federated
Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving, decentralized model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. FL enables cross-silo collaboration
among banks while also using cross-device learning on IoT endpoints. This
survey explores the role of FL in enhancing financial security and introduces a
novel classification of its applications based on regulatory and compliance
exposure levels ranging from low-exposure tasks such as collaborative portfolio
optimization to high-exposure tasks like real-time fraud detection. Unlike
prior surveys, this work reviews FL's practical use within financial systems,
discussing its regulatory compliance and recent successes in fraud prevention
and blockchain-integrated frameworks. However, FL deployment in finance is not
without challenges. Data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks, and regulatory
compliance make implementation far from easy. This survey reviews current
defense mechanisms and discusses future directions, including blockchain
integration, differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, and
quantum-secure frameworks. Ultimately, this work aims to be a resource for
researchers exploring FL's potential to advance secure, privacy-compliant
financial systems.
