The higher the score, the\nmore difficult it is to generate code for the specification.

Our experimental results show that strong LLMs\n(like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do\nvery poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate\nbusiness logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and\ninclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication.

Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show\npromise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:\nnearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative\ninteractions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In\nthis study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that\naddresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the\nsynthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,\nChimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for\nSMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)\nsynthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.\nDuring fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing\nformulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.\nThis design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.\nNotably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,\ndramatically reducing runtime cost.

While traces\nand metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing\nmethods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to\nevolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning\nprocess, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused.

With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks\ntargeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware\nacross various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to\nextend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep\nlearning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of\nlabeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient\nmalware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage\nthe ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for\nmalware detection.

In addition, CPS simulators may be\nflaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test\nre-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not\nrequire system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.\nIdeally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human\nunderstanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential\nflakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test\noracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the\ninputs of the system under test.

With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks\ntargeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware\nacross various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to\nextend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep\nlearning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of\nlabeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient\nmalware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage\nthe ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for\nmalware detection. Specifically, when dealing with malware in a certain ISA, we\ntranslate it to an ISA with sufficient malware samples (like X86-64).

Our approach reduces the data collection effort by enabling malware\ndetection across multiple ISAs using a model trained on a single ISA."}
