### [1] [Attention Augmented GNN RNN-Attention Models for Advanced Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25802)
*Jayant Biradar,Smit Shah,Tanmay Naik*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning model combining GNNs, RNNs, and multi-head attention achieves better intrusion detection than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cybersecurity requires detecting complex threats in real-time using models that capture spatial and temporal patterns while being interpretable.

Method: Hybrid model using GNNs for spatial dependencies, RNNs for temporal dynamics, and attention for interpretability and feature selection.

Result: Outperforms traditional ML and standalone DL models in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, especially on advanced threats like APTs and DDoS.

Conclusion: Hybrid architecture offers a promising foundation for next-gen intrusion detection systems in complex networks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that
synergistically combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms to significantly enhance
cybersecurity intrusion detection capabilities. By leveraging the comprehensive
UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach
effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural
relationships and temporal dynamics through sequential analysis of network
events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of improved
model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling cybersecurity
analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security events -- a
critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection systems. Our
extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model
achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine learning
approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple evaluation
metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model
achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated attack
patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising solution
for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network environments.

### [2] [APThreatHunter: An automated planning-based threat hunting framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25806)
*Mustafa F. Abdelwahed,Ahmed Shafee,Joan Espasa*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces APThreatHunter, an automated threat hunting solution that generates hypotheses with minimal human intervention, which was evaluated using real-world Android malware samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber attacks pose significant threats, and current threat hunting methods are manual, time-consuming, and biased. There is a need for an automated solution to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Method: APThreatHunter uses automated planning to generate hypotheses based on the system's current state and indicators of potential threats. It minimizes human intervention and eliminates analyst bias.

Result: The evaluation with real-world Android malware samples showed that APThreatHunter is practical for automated hypothesis generation in cyber threat hunting.

Conclusion: APThreatHunter demonstrates the feasibility of using automated planning for threat hunting, offering a practical and efficient alternative to manual processes.

Abstract: Cyber attacks threaten economic interests, critical infrastructure, and
public health and safety. To counter this, entities adopt cyber threat hunting,
a proactive approach that involves formulating hypotheses and searching for
attack patterns within organisational networks. Automating cyber threat hunting
presents challenges, particularly in generating hypotheses, as it is a manually
created and confirmed process, making it time-consuming. To address these
challenges, we introduce APThreatHunter, an automated threat hunting solution
that generates hypotheses with minimal human intervention, eliminating analyst
bias and reducing time and cost. This is done by presenting possible risks
based on the system's current state and a set of indicators to indicate whether
any of the detected risks are happening or not. We evaluated APThreatHunter
using real-world Android malware samples, and the results revealed the
practicality of using automated planning for goal hypothesis generation in
cyber threat hunting activities.

### [3] [Adversarial Pre-Padding: Generating Evasive Network Traffic Against Transformer-Based Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25810)
*Quanliang Jing,Xinxin Fan,Yanyan Liu,Jingping Bi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A new adversarial traffic-gener...


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic obfuscation techniques are vulnerable to high-accuracy transformer-based classifiers. This study aims to counter these models with a novel adversarial approach.

Method: The method involves a pre-padding strategy and a reinforcement learning model to optimize traffic perturbations, specifically targeting transformer-based classifiers.

Result: Experimental results show a significant reduction in classification accuracy of transformer-based models from 99% to as low as 25.68% across real-world datasets.

Conclusion: AdvTraffic is the first to apply adversarial perturbations against transformer-based traffic classifiers, offering effective and practical defense by combining pre-padding and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: To date, traffic obfuscation techniques have been widely adopted to protect
network data privacy and security by obscuring the true patterns of traffic.
Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based
classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly
vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic
classification accuracy up to 99\% or higher. To counter such high-performance
transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and
effective \underline{adv}ersarial \underline{traffic}-generating approach
(AdvTraffic\footnote{The code and data are available at: http://xxx}). Our
approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to
modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing
research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification;
and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic
perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against
transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend
against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be
easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted
experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively
undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification
accuracy from 99\% to as low as 25.68\%.

### [5] [A Critical Roadmap to Driver Authentication via CAN Bus: Dataset Review, Introduction of the Kidmose CANid Dataset (KCID), and Proof of Concept](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25856)
*Brooke Elizabeth Kidmose,Andreas Brasen Kidmose,Cliff C. Zou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a new dataset and methodology for driver authentication via CAN bus data to enhance vehicle security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vehicles are vulnerable to theft and unauthorized use, with existing datasets and methods limited in scope and practical application.

Method: A comprehensive review of existing datasets and the collection of a new dataset (KCID) with raw CAN bus data. The paper also introduces a driver authentication framework and prototype implementation.

Result: The paper demonstrates the practical feasibility of CAN bus-based driver authentication through live trials and explores additional applications of the dataset.

Conclusion: The new dataset and framework provide a robust foundation for developing deployable driver authentication systems to enhance vehicle security and enable various applications like insurance and safety assessments.

Abstract: Modern vehicles remain vulnerable to unauthorized use and theft despite
traditional security measures including immobilizers and keyless entry systems.
Criminals exploit vulnerabilities in Controller Area Network (CAN) bus systems
to bypass authentication mechanisms, while social media trends have expanded
auto theft to include recreational joyriding by underage drivers. Driver
authentication via CAN bus data offers a promising additional layer of
defense-in-depth protection, but existing open-access driver fingerprinting
datasets suffer from critical limitations including reliance on decoded
diagnostic data rather than raw CAN traffic, artificial fixed-route
experimental designs, insufficient sampling rates, and lack of demographic
information.
  This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing open-access driver
fingerprinting datasets, analyzing their strengths and limitations to guide
practitioners in dataset selection. We introduce the Kidmose CANid Dataset
(KCID), which addresses these fundamental shortcomings by providing raw CAN bus
data from 16 drivers across four vehicles, including essential demographic
information and both daily driving and controlled fixed-route data. Beyond
dataset contributions, we present a driver authentication anti-theft framework
and implement a proof-of-concept prototype on a single-board computer. Through
live road trials with an unaltered passenger vehicle, we demonstrate the
practical feasibility of CAN bus-based driver authentication anti-theft
systems. Finally, we explore diverse applications of KCID beyond driver
authentication, including driver profiling for insurance and safety
assessments, mechanical anomaly detection, young driver monitoring, and
impaired driving detection. This work provides researchers with both the data
and methodological foundation necessary to develop robust, deployable driver
authentication systems...

TL;DR: AAGATE is a Kubernetes-native control plane for secure deployment of autonomous AI agents, using the NIST AI RMF and additional security frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AppSec tools are inadequate for improvisational AI agents, necessitating a new governance solution for systemic, adversarial, and ethical risks.

Method: AAGATE integrates MAESTRO for threat modeling (Map), a hybrid of AIVSS and SSVC for measurement (Measure), and Agentic AI Red Teaming Guide for risk management (Manage). It also includes a service mesh, policy engine, analytics, and DIRF/LPCI/QSAF components.

Result: AAGATE provides continuous governance, enabling safe, accountable, and scalable agentic AI while mitigating risks across the NIST RMF framework.

Conclusion: AAGATE's novel approach combining multiple frameworks and native cloud integration offers a robust solution for AI governance at production scale.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Agentic AI Governance Assurance & Trust Engine
(AAGATE), a Kubernetes-native control plane designed to address the unique
security and governance challenges posed by autonomous, language-model-driven
agents in production. Recognizing the limitations of traditional Application
Security (AppSec) tooling for improvisational, machine-speed systems, AAGATE
operationalizes the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). It integrates
specialized security frameworks for each RMF function: the Agentic AI Threat
Modeling MAESTRO framework for Map, a hybrid of OWASP's AIVSS and SEI's SSVC
for Measure, and the Cloud Security Alliance's Agentic AI Red Teaming Guide for
Manage. By incorporating a zero-trust service mesh, an explainable policy
engine, behavioral analytics, and decentralized accountability hooks, AAGATE
provides a continuous, verifiable governance solution for agentic AI, enabling
safe, accountable, and scalable deployment. The framework is further extended
with DIRF for digital identity rights, LPCI defenses for logic-layer injection,
and QSAF monitors for cognitive degradation, ensuring governance spans
systemic, adversarial, and ethical risks.

### [8] [FakeZero: Real-Time, Privacy-Preserving Misinformation Detection for Facebook and X](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25932)
*Soufiane Essahli,Oussama Sarsar,Imane Fouad,Anas Motii,Ahmed Bentajer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents FakeZero, a lightweight browser
extension that detects fake news on social platforms
during scrolling, using optimized machine learning
models for efficient client-side performance without
compromising privacy. It also enables data collection for
research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the rapid spread of
misinformation through social platforms, which threatens
public discourse. It highlights the need for effective,
privacy-preserving detection tools.

Method: FakeZero is a browser extension
running entirely client-side using the Chromium messaging
API. The team uses a three-stage training process: baseline
fine-tuning, domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal
loss, adversarial augmentation, and post-training
quantization.

Result: FakeZero's DistilBERT-Quant model achieves 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and 0.996 AUROC with 103 ms
latency, while TinyBERT-Quant retains high performance
(95.7% macro-F1, 96.1% accuracy) with 40 ms latency and
reduced size (14.7 MB) under resource constraints.

Conclusion: FakeZero demonstrates high-performance fake
news detection can be done on a client device with minimal
latency and data privacy, aiding policymakers in limiting
disinformation and helping researchers gather real-world
fake news datasets for future improvement.

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.

### [9] [SoK: Honeypots & LLMs, More Than the Sum of Their Parts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25939)
*Robert A. Bridges,Thomas R. Mitchell,Mauricio Muñoz,Ted Henriksson*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This SoK paper offers a comprehensive overview of LLM-based honeypot research, detailing detection vectors, architectural patterns, and evaluation methods, while outlining a roadmap for autonomous deception systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incremental progress and lack of cohesive understanding in LLM-based honeypot design by providing a structured analysis of existing literature and future directions.

Method: Survey and systematization of three areas: honeypot detection vectors, LLM-honeypot architectures and evaluations, and the evolution of honeypot log analysis.

Result: Identification of a canonical LLM-honeypot architecture, key evaluation trends, and the evolutionary path of log analysis; a roadmap for autonomous self-improving systems.

Conclusion: The potential of LLM-based honeypots lies in autonomous, self-improving deception systems to counter intelligent, automated attackers.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised to resolve the
long-standing paradox in honeypot design: achieving high-fidelity deception
with low operational risk. However, despite a flurry of research since late
2022, progress has been incremental, and the field lacks a cohesive
understanding of the emerging architectural patterns, core challenges, and
evaluation paradigms. To fill this gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)
paper provides the first comprehensive overview of this new domain. We survey
and systematize three critical, intersecting research areas: first, we provide
a taxonomy of honeypot detection vectors, structuring the core problems that
LLM-based realism must solve; second, we synthesize the emerging literature on
LLM-honeypots, identifying a canonical architecture and key evaluation trends;
and third, we chart the evolutionary path of honeypot log analysis, from simple
data reduction to automated intelligence generation. We synthesize these
findings into a forward-looking research roadmap, arguing that the true
potential of this technology lies in creating autonomous, self-improving
deception systems to counter the emerging threat of intelligent, automated
attackers.

### [10] [WaveVerif: Acoustic Side-Channel based Verification of Robotic Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25960)
*Zeynep Yasemin Erdogan,Shishir Nagaraja,Chuadhry Mujeeb Ahmed,Ryan Shah*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Acoustic monitoring with ML classifies robot commands accurately (80%+), enabling low-cost, hardware-free verification for sensitive environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable, non-invasive real-time verification in sensitive robotic environments where hardware modifications are impractical or undesirable.

Method: Machine-learning workflow using acoustic emissions from robotic movements, evaluated with SVM, DNN, RNN, and CNN under varied speed, direction, and microphone distance conditions.

Result: 80%+ accuracy in individual movement validation and workflow identification (pick-and-place, packing) across four classifiers without hardware alterations.

Conclusion: Acoustic signals enable real-time, low-cost passive verification of robotic commands without hardware changes, as demonstrated through high classification accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework that uses acoustic side-channel
analysis (ASCA) to monitor and verify whether a robot correctly executes its
intended commands. We develop and evaluate a machine-learning-based workflow
verification system that uses acoustic emissions generated by robotic
movements. The system can determine whether real-time behavior is consistent
with expected commands. The evaluation takes into account movement speed,
direction, and microphone distance. The results show that individual robot
movements can be validated with over 80% accuracy under baseline conditions
using four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural
Network (DNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Additionally, workflows such as pick-and-place and packing could be
identified with similarly high confidence. Our findings demonstrate that
acoustic signals can support real-time, low-cost, passive verification in
sensitive robotic environments without requiring hardware modifications.

### [11] [Message Recovery Attack in NTRU via Knapsack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26003)
*Eirini Poimenidou,K. A. Draziotis*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a message-recovery attack on NTRU-HPS variants using a modular knapsack problem, successfully recovering messages with 45% known coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the security of NTRU-HPS cryptosystems by exploring how much information about a message is required for feasible recovery, highlighting vulnerabilities in assumptions of message secrecy.

Method: The method involves reducing message decryption to solving a modular knapsack problem through a FLATTER reduction, leveraging partial knowledge of message and nonce vector coefficients to find short vectors in a lattice.

Result: The attack successfully recovers messages when approximately 45% of coefficients are known, with practical implementation achieving recovery in minutes on standard hardware.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that partial knowledge of message coefficients significantly weakens NTRU-HPS security, implying the need for stronger assumptions or additional protections against such attacks.

Abstract: In the present paper, we introduce a message-recovery attack based on the
Modular Knapsack Problem, applicable to all variants of the NTRU-HPS
cryptosystem. Assuming that a fraction $\epsilon$ of the coefficients of the
message ${\bf{m}}\in\{-1,0,1\}^N$ and of the nonce vector ${\bf
r}\in\{-1,0,1\}^N$ are known in advance at random positions, we reduce message
decryption to finding a short vector in a lattice that encodes an instance of a
modular knapsack system. This allows us to address a key question: how much
information about ${\bf m}$, or about the pair $({\bf m},{\bf r})$, is required
before recovery becomes feasible? A FLATTER reduction successfully recovers the
message, in practice when $\epsilon\approx 0.45$. Our implementation finds
${\bf m}$ within a few minutes on a commodity desktop.

### [12] [SIRAJ: Diverse and Efficient Red-Teaming for LLM Agents via Distilled Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26037)
*Kaiwen Zhou,Ahmed Elgohary,A S M Iftekhar,Amin Saied*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SIRAJ is a framework for red-teaming LLM agents, using a dynamic two-step process and model distillation to improve safety and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents planning and using tools introduce new safety risks, necessitating a comprehensive red-teaming system to discover vulnerabilities and ensure safe deployment.

Method: 1. Dynamic two-step process with agent definition and diverse seed test cases. 2. Model-based adversarial attack construction and refinement. 3. Model distillation with structured reasoning to reduce costs.

Result: Coverage of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories increased 2-2.5x, and the distilled 8B model outperformed a 671B model by 100% success rate.

Conclusion: SIRAJ effectively enhances safety testing and attack success, demonstrating efficiency and scalability in red-teaming LLM agents.

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

### [13] [PEEL: A Poisoning-Exposing Encoding Theoretical Framework for Local Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26102)
*Lisha Shuai,Jiuling Dong,Nan Zhang,Shaofeng Tan,Haokun Zhang,Zilong Song,Gaoya Dong,Xiaolong Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PEEL is a lightweight, prior-free framework for LDP that effectively detects poisoning attacks and improves IoT scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDP defenses suffer from high resource overheads or depend on domain-specific prior knowledge, limiting their practicality in IoT environments.

Method: PEEL leverages the inherent structural consistency of LDP-perturbed data through sparsification, normalization, and low-rank projection to amplify and expose poisoning effects in a reconstructed space.

Result: PEEL outperforms existing defenses in poisoning exposure accuracy and reduces client-side computational costs, validating its robustness and practicality.

Conclusion: PEEL effectively detects output and rule poisoning attacks in LDP without requiring prior knowledge or incurring resource overhead, making it ideal for large-scale IoT deployments.

Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is a widely adopted privacy-protection model
in the Internet of Things (IoT) due to its lightweight, decentralized, and
scalable nature. However, it is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, and existing
defenses either incur prohibitive resource overheads or rely on domain-specific
prior knowledge, limiting their practical deployment. To address these
limitations, we propose PEEL, a Poisoning-Exposing Encoding theoretical
framework for LDP, which departs from resource- or prior-dependent
countermeasures and instead leverages the inherent structural consistency of
LDP-perturbed data. As a non-intrusive post-processing module, PEEL amplifies
stealthy poisoning effects by re-encoding LDP-perturbed data via
sparsification, normalization, and low-rank projection, thereby revealing both
output and rule poisoning attacks through structural inconsistencies in the
reconstructed space. Theoretical analysis proves that PEEL, integrated with
LDP, retains unbiasedness and statistical accuracy, while being robust to
expose both output and rule poisoning attacks. Moreover, evaluation results
show that LDP-integrated PEEL not only outperforms four state-of-the-art
defenses in terms of poisoning exposure accuracy but also significantly reduces
client-side computational costs, making it highly suitable for large-scale IoT
deployments.

### [14] [Security Vulnerabilities in AI-Generated Code: A Large-Scale Analysis of Public GitHub Repositories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26103)
*Maximilian Schreiber,Pascal Tippe*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Empirical study identifies security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code in a large GitHub sample


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and addressing security risks in AI-generated code is crucial as AI integration in software development increases, yet prior work has not studied its documentation generation role.

Method: Analyzed 7,703 AI-attributed GitHub files from ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and Tabnine using CodeQL for CWE mapping, comparing languages and tools

Result: 87.9% of AI code had no vulnerabilities. Python had higher vulnerability rates. GitHub Copilot excelled in Python/TypeScript security while ChatGPT outperformed in JavaScript. 39% of files were documentation-related.

Conclusion: Study confirms prior results with a larger dataset, highlights language/tool differences and documentation generation use, and offers guidance for context-aware secure AI integration

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of security
vulnerabilities in AI-generated code across public GitHub repositories. We
collected and analyzed 7,703 files explicitly attributed to four major AI
tools: ChatGPT (91.52\%), GitHub Copilot (7.50\%), Amazon CodeWhisperer
(0.52\%), and Tabnine (0.46\%). Using CodeQL static analysis, we identified
4,241 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) instances across 77 distinct
vulnerability types. Our findings reveal that while 87.9\% of AI-generated code
does not contain identifiable CWE-mapped vulnerabilities, significant patterns
emerge regarding language-specific vulnerabilities and tool performance. Python
consistently exhibited higher vulnerability rates (16.18\%-18.50\%) compared to
JavaScript (8.66\%-8.99\%) and TypeScript (2.50\%-7.14\%) across all tools. We
observed notable differences in security performance, with GitHub Copilot
achieving better security density for Python (1,739 LOC per CWE) and
TypeScript, while ChatGPT performed better for JavaScript. Additionally, we
discovered widespread use of AI tools for documentation generation (39\% of
collected files), an understudied application with implications for software
maintainability. These findings extend previous work with a significantly
larger dataset and provide valuable insights for developing language-specific
and context-aware security practices for the responsible integration of
AI-generated code into software development workflows.

### [15] [Confidential FRIT via Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26179)
*Haruki Hoshino,Jungjin Park,Osamu Kaneko,Kiminao Kogiso*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a confidential data-driven gain-tuning framework using homomorphic encryption schemes like ElGamal and CKKS to improve cybersecurity in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that outsource computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) face vulnerabilities when outsourcing gain-tuning processes, as cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated. Traditional IT security measures are insufficient for CPSs.

Method: The framework uses homomorphic encryption to secure the gain-tuning process. Matrix inversion is replaced with vector summation for encryption compatibility, implementing a confidential FRIT model.

Result: Numerical experiments with 128-bit security demonstrate the framework's performance is similar to existing methods, thus proving its efficacy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances cybersecurity in CPSs with data-driven gain-tuning. It offers practical encryption guidelines while maintaining system performance.

Abstract: Edge computing alleviates the computation burden of data-driven control in
cyber-physical systems (CPSs) by offloading complex processing to edge servers.
However, the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks underscores the need for
security measures that go beyond conventional IT protections and address the
unique vulnerabilities of CPSs. This study proposes a confidential data-driven
gain-tuning framework using homomorphic encryption, such as ElGamal and CKKS
encryption schemes, to enhance cybersecurity in gain-tuning processes
outsourced to external servers. The idea for realizing confidential FRIT is to
replace the matrix inversion operation with a vector summation form, allowing
homomorphic operations to be applied. Numerical examples under 128-bit security
confirm performance comparable to conventional methods while providing
guidelines for selecting suitable encryption schemes for secure CPS.

*Junlin Liu,Zhaomeng Deng,Ziming Wang,Mengyu Yao,Yifeng Cai,Yutao Hu,Ziqi Zhang,Yao Guo,Ding Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper highlights a security issue in super apps where users can easily delete transaction records without strong authentication. An empirical study with six volunteers across six apps found that 83% lacked strong protection for deleting records, emphasizing the need for better post-transaction security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Super apps deeply integrate financial activities into daily life, and existing security measures only focus on pre-transaction authentication. The deletion of transaction history without appropriate safeguards can conceal malicious actions, which is a significant oversight in current practices.

Method: The authors conducted an empirical study involving six volunteers who tested six super apps to evaluate how secure and verifiable transaction deletion features are. They focused on whether strong authentication (like biometrics) was required to delete transaction records.

Result: All six super apps allowed users to delete transaction records, but only one app required biometric verification. Five out of six (83%+) failed to protect these deletions with strong authentication, exposing a critical vulnerability.

Conclusion: The study provides the first concrete evidence that post-transaction audit integrity is a widespread and under-recognized security flaw in super apps. It calls for a paradigm shift to enhance security in protecting audit trails after transactions.

Abstract: Super apps are the cornerstones of modern digital life, embedding financial
transactions into nearly every aspect of daily routine. The prevailing security
paradigm for these platforms is overwhelmingly focused on pre-transaction
authentication, preventing unauthorized payments before they occur. We argue
that a critical vulnerability vector has been largely overlooked: the fragility
of post-transaction audit trails. We investigate the ease with which a user can
permanently erase their transaction history from an app's interface, thereby
concealing unauthorized or sensitive activities from the account owner. To
quantify this threat, we conducted an empirical study with 6 volunteers who
performed a cross-evaluation on six super apps. Our findings are alarming: all
six applications studied allow users to delete transaction records, yet a
staggering five out of six (83+\%) fail to protect these records with strong
authentication. Only one app in our study required biometric verification for
deletion. This study provides the first concrete evidence of this
near-ubiquitous vulnerability, demonstrating a critical gap in the current
mobile security landscape and underscoring the urgent need for a paradigm shift
towards ensuring post-transaction audit integrity.

### [17] [Who Grants the Agent Power? Defending Against Instruction Injection via Task-Centric Access Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26212)
*Yifeng Cai,Ziming Wang,Zhaomeng Deng,Mengyu Yao,Junlin Liu,Yutao Hu,Ziqi Zhang,Yao Guo,Ding Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes AgentSentry, a dynamic access control framework that prevents instruction injection attacks on AI agents by enforcing task-scoped permissions, demonstrating its ability to block malicious actions while preserving legitimate task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents relying on over-privileged static permissions are vulnerable to instruction injection attacks (e.g., malicious emails hijacking agents to forward private data). This exposes a critical need for task-specific dynamic access control mechanisms.

Method: AgentSentry employs a lightweight runtime framework that dynamically generates and enforces minimal, temporary access control policies tied to specific tasks (e.g., 'register for an app'), revoking permissions once the task is completed, replacing broad static permissions.

Result: Evaluation shows AgentSentry successfully prevents instruction injection attacks (e.g., blocking unauthorized email forwarding) while allowing legitimate tasks to complete, confirming its effectiveness without compromising functionality.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the urgent need for intent-aligned security models to safely govern future autonomous agents, as demonstrated by the effectiveness of AgentSentry in preventing instruction injection attacks.

Abstract: AI agents capable of GUI understanding and Model Context Protocol are
increasingly deployed to automate mobile tasks. However, their reliance on
over-privileged, static permissions creates a critical vulnerability:
instruction injection. Malicious instructions, embedded in otherwise benign
content like emails, can hijack the agent to perform unauthorized actions. We
present AgentSentry, a lightweight runtime task-centric access control
framework that enforces dynamic, task-scoped permissions. Instead of granting
broad, persistent permissions, AgentSentry dynamically generates and enforces
minimal, temporary policies aligned with the user's specific task (e.g.,
register for an app), revoking them upon completion. We demonstrate that
AgentSentry successfully prevents an instruction injection attack, where an
agent is tricked into forwarding private emails, while allowing the legitimate
task to complete. Our approach highlights the urgent need for intent-aligned
security models to safely govern the next generation of autonomous agents.

### [18] [PVMark: Enabling Public Verifiability for LLM Watermarking Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26274)
*Haohua Duan,Liyao Xiang,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PVMark introduces a zero-knowledge proof-based plugin to enable public verifiability of LLM watermark detection without exposing secret keys, resolving trust issues in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM watermarking schemes face a trust dilemma where secret keys must remain non-public (to prevent attacks) yet private (making detection unverified). This opaqueness hinders transparency and accountability.

Method: The authors propose PVMark, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to create a publicly verifiable `proof of correct execution` for watermark detection. Key technical components include ZKP constraints for mapping, random number generation, comparison, and summation, implemented across multiple variants in Python, Rust, and Circom.

Result: PVMark variants demonstrate effective public verifiability across three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and four ZKP protocols. Experiments confirm no degradation in watermarking performance, with practical deployment potential.

Conclusion: PVMark addresses the trust gap in LLM watermarking by combining ZKP with detection, achieving transparency without compromising security or efficiency, paving the way for real-world application.

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

### [19] [A Survey of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26307)
*Laura Jiang,Reza Ryan,Qian Li,Nasim Ferdosian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper provides a survey on HGNN-based anomaly detection in cybersecurity, addressing fragmented research with a taxonomy, dataset reviews, and future directions towards scalable and deploypable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address limitations in current graph-based anomaly detection methods used in cybersecurity, such as reliance on homogeneous and static graphs, towards establishing more expressive HGNNs with standardized benchmarks to enhance scalability and practical deployment.

Method: The research method involves a comprehensive review and classification of HGNN-based anomaly detection through a proposed taxonomy based on anomaly types and graph dynamics, analysis of representative models, mapping to cybersecurity applications, and evaluation of benchmark datasets and metrics.

Result: The results of the survey include a taxonomy for categorizing HGNN-based methods, an overview of representative models and their applications in cybersecurity, analysis of benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics used, and an outline of open challenges.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the need for standardized benchmarking and more research on scalable, interpretable, and practially deployable HGNN-based anomaly detection, while acknowledging remaining challenges in modeling, data, and deployment aspects.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in cybersecurity, where identifying
insider threats, access violations, and coordinated attacks is essential for
ensuring system resilience. Graph-based approaches have become increasingly
important for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and
static structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and
temporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by
incorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation,
enabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current
research on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse
modeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of
standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey
of HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a
taxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze
representative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also
review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting
their strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges
related to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for
future research. This survey aims to establish a structured foundation for
advancing HGNN-based anomaly detection toward scalable, interpretable, and
practically deployable solutions.

### [20] [SSCL-BW: Sample-Specific Clean-Label Backdoor Watermarking for Dataset Ownership Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26420)
*Yingjia Wang,Ting Qiao,Xing Liu,Chongzuo Li,Sixing Wu,Jianbin Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes SSCL-BW, a sample-specific clean-label backdoor watermarking method using a U-Net-based generator with a composite loss function to overcome limitations of existing dataset ownership verification techniques, achieving robust and imperceptible protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset ownership verification methods face limitations such as detectable poison-label watermarks, high-complexity clean-label watermarks, and vulnerability due to static watermark patterns. This motivates the need for a dynamic, sample-specific approach to protect dataset intellectual property rights.

Method: The method involves training a U-Net-based watermarked sample generator using a composite loss function with three components: target sample loss (ensures watermark effectiveness), non-target sample loss (guarantees trigger reliability), and perceptual similarity loss (maintains visual imperceptibility).

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in verifying ownership through black-box testing and robustness against potential watermark removal attacks, outperforming existing approaches in stealth and reliability.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SSCL-BW addresses limitations of existing methods by introducing sample-specific watermarks through a U-Net-based generator with a composite loss function, enhancing intellectual property protection for datasets while maintaining robustness against watermark removal attacks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) heavily relies on
large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, unauthorized commercial use of
these datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset
owners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer
from inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to
label inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical
complexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches
employ static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.
To address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label
backdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked
sample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,
fundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The
core innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three
components: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target
sample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss
maintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box
testing is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined
backdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential
watermark removal attacks.

### [21] [CyberNER: A Harmonized STIX Corpus for Cybersecurity Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26499)
*Yasir Ech-Chammakhy,Anas Motii,Anass Rabii,Oussama Azrara,Jaafar Chbili*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CyberNER addresses inconsistent cybersecurity NER datasets by unifying four resources into a STIX 2.1 standardized corpus, achieving a 30% F1-score improvement for entity extraction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cybersecurity NER datasets suffer from incompatible annotation schemas, leading to noisy labels and poor model performance when naively combined. A unified benchmark is needed for effective model development.

Method: CyberNER was developed by harmonizing four datasets (CyNER, DNRTI, APTNER, and Attacker) onto the STIX 2.1 framework, consolidating 50+ tags into 21 coherent entity types to resolve annotation inconsistencies.

Result: Models trained on CyberNER achieved a 30% relative F1-score improvement over the naive concatenation baseline, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Conclusion: The creation of CyberNER provides a standardized benchmark for developing and comparing robust NER models in cybersecurity, enhancing entity extraction performance significantly.

Abstract: Extracting structured intelligence via Named Entity Recognition (NER) is
critical for cybersecurity, but the proliferation of datasets with incompatible
annotation schemas hinders the development of comprehensive models. While
combining these resources is desirable, we empirically demonstrate that naively
concatenating them results in a noisy label space that severely degrades model
performance. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce CyberNER, a
large-scale, unified corpus created by systematically harmonizing four
prominent datasets (CyNER, DNRTI, APTNER, and Attacker) onto the STIX 2.1
standard. Our principled methodology resolves semantic ambiguities and
consolidates over 50 disparate source tags into 21 coherent entity types. Our
experiments show that models trained on CyberNER achieve a substantial
performance gain, with a relative F1-score improvement of approximately 30%
over the naive concatenation baseline. By publicly releasing the CyberNER
corpus, we provide a crucial, standardized benchmark that enables the creation
and rigorous comparison of more robust and generalizable entity extraction
models for the cybersecurity domain.

### [22] [Interdependent Privacy in Smart Homes: Hunting for Bystanders in Privacy Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26523)
*Shuaishuai Liu,Gergely Acs,Gergely Biczók*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study analyzes the privacy policies of 20 smart home devices to assess how they address bystander privacy, revealing a lack of robust regulatory incentives and ethical responsibilities placed on device owners; the paper provides recommendations for improving transparency and empowering users and bystanders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart home devices like video doorbells raise privacy concerns for non-users (bystanders), and their privacy policies may not reflect necessary regulatory incentives due to lax data protection laws in shared physical spaces.

Method: The paper conducted a focused analysis of 20 video doorbell and smart camera products' privacy policies, identifying how they address bystander privacy, examining real-world cases, and evaluating them within existing legal and technical frameworks.

Result: The analysis found that while some vendors mention bystanders, they primarily use disclaimers to shift ethical responsibility to device owners and do not provide adequate solutions for bystander privacy concerns.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with practical recommendations for improving privacy policies and system design to enhance transparency and empower both device owners and bystanders in the context of smart home technology.

Abstract: Smart home devices such as video doorbells and security cameras are becoming
increasingly common in everyday life. While these devices offer convenience and
safety, they also raise new privacy concerns: how these devices affect others,
like neighbors, visitors, or people passing by. This issue is generally known
as interdependent privacy, where one person's actions (or inaction) may impact
the privacy of others, and, specifically, bystander privacy in the context of
smart homes. Given lax data protection regulations in terms of shared physical
spaces and amateur joint data controllers, we expect that the privacy policies
of smart home products reflect the missing regulatory incentives. This paper
presents a focused privacy policy analysis of 20 video doorbell and smart
camera products, concentrating explicitly on the bystander aspect. We show that
although some of the vendors acknowledge bystanders, they address it only to
the extent of including disclaimers, shifting the ethical responsibility for
collecting the data of non-users to the device owner. In addition, we identify
and examine real-world cases related to bystander privacy, demonstrating how
current deployments can impact non-users. Based on our findings, we analyze
vendor privacy policies in light of existing legal frameworks and technical
capabilities, and we provide practical recommendations for both policy language
and system design to enhance transparency and empower both bystanders and
device owners.

applications continues to increase, and the cybersecurity challenges we face
are also escalating. This paper aims to investigate the methods and practices
of system security penetration testing, exploring how to enhance system
security through systematic penetration testing processes and technical
approaches. It also examines existing penetration tools, analyzing their
strengths, weaknesses, and applicable domains to guide penetration testers in
tool selection. Furthermore, based on the penetration testing process outlined
in this paper, appropriate tools are selected to replicate attack processes
using target ranges and target machines. Finally, through practical case
analysis, lessons learned from successful attacks are summarized to inform
future research.

### [24] [A DRL-Empowered Multi-Level Jamming Approach for Secure Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26610)
*Weixuan Chen,Qianqian Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a DRL-based multi-level jamming system to secure semantic communication. By combining semantic and physical layer jamming with DDPG optimization, it enhances security and improves legitimate user PSNR compared to encryption-based and jammer-based alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic communication (SemCom) transmits only task-relevant information, but this efficiency exposes semantic content to eavesdropping vulnerabilities.

Method: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with two jamming layers: semantic layer jamming (task-irrelevant text) and physical layer jamming (random Gaussian noise). DDPG algorithm optimizes precoding matrices, and an alternating optimization strategy jointly trains the SemCom model and DDPG agent.

Result: Achieved comparable security to existing benchmarks (ESCS and EJ) while improving the legitimate user's peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to 0.6 dB.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL-empowered multi-level jamming strategy effectively enhances SemCom security while improving legitimate user performance, demonstrating a viable approach to balancing efficiency and privacy.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) aims to transmit only task-relevant
information, thereby improving communication efficiency but also exposing
semantic information to potential eavesdropping. In this paper, we propose a
deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to
enhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This
approach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant
text, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise.
These two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic
information to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping. A deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is further introduced to
dynamically design and optimize the precoding matrices for both taskrelevant
semantic information and multi-level jamming signals, aiming to enhance the
legitimate user's image reconstruction while degrading the eavesdropper's
performance. To jointly train the SemCom model and the DDPG agent, we propose
an alternating optimization strategy where the two modules are updated
iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with both the
encryption-based (ESCS) and encoded jammer-based (EJ) benchmarks, our method
achieves comparable security while improving the legitimate user's peak
signalto-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to approximately 0.6 dB.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automated threat modeling method using clustering algorithms on call graphs, validated through a case study showing its effectiveness for cloud-native security assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual threat modeling is labor-intensive and error-prone, creating a need for automation in identifying security risks.

Method: The proposed method uses density-based and community detection algorithms to cluster call graphs, followed by analyzing threats in identified clusters.

Result: Evaluation with the Splunk Forwarder Operator case study demonstrated the approach's viability in assessing code-density security weaknesses.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the advancement of scalable, semi-automated threat modeling frameworks tailored for modern cloud-native environments.

Abstract: Threat modeling plays a critical role in the identification and mitigation of
security risks; however, manual approaches are often labor intensive and prone
to error. This paper investigates the automation of software threat modeling
through the clustering of call graphs using density-based and community
detection algorithms, followed by an analysis of the threats associated with
the identified clusters. The proposed method was evaluated through a case study
of the Splunk Forwarder Operator (SFO), wherein selected clustering metrics
were applied to the software's call graph to assess pertinent code-density
security weaknesses. The results demonstrate the viability of the approach and
underscore its potential to facilitate systematic threat assessment. This work
contributes to the advancement of scalable, semi-automated threat modeling
frameworks tailored for modern cloud-native environments.

*Wenhao Yang,Minghui Zhou,Daniel Izquierdo Cortázar,Yehui Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a holistic risk governance framework for enterprise open source engagement, operationalizing a risk principle through the OTVM model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises integrating open source strategically face complex systemic risks beyond technical issues that traditional risk management fails to address.

Method: A grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a framework based on the interplay of external threats and internal vulnerabilities.

Result: Developed a framework with a Strategic Objectives Matrix, external/ internal threat/vulnerability taxonomies, and actionable mitigation strategies validated by industry experts.

Conclusion: The framework provides a systematic path for enterprises to move from reactive to proactive risk management in open source integration.

Abstract: Enterprise engagement with open source has evolved from tactical adoption to
strategic deep integration, exposing them to a complex risk landscape far
beyond mere code. However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on
technical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream
"silent fixes", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a
dangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable
the necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,
we conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a
holistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical
framework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External
Threat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a
critical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an
undefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the
impact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical
chain: "Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation" (OTVM). This
provides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.
Based on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a "Strategic Objectives Matrix"
to clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,
Ex-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and
(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these
vulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three
industry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.
This work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for
enterprises to shift from reactive "firefighting" to proactively building an
organizational "immune system".

*Tong Ma,Hui Lai,Hui Wang,Zhenhu Tian,Jizhou Wang,Haichao Wu,Yongfan Gao,Chaochao Li,Fengjie Xu,Ling Fang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PRISM combines LLMs with MDE to create regulator-ready, machine-checkable artifacts for safety- and compliance-critical domains using a UMM, ICM, and CVG to ensure compliance and reduce manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of generating regulator-ready and machine-checkable artifacts in safety- and compliance-critical domains using traditional methods, which are often manual, error-prone, and inefficient. The motivation is to provide a practical solution for automated artifact generation with built-in assurance.

Method: PRISM uses three main components: a Unified Meta-Model (UMM) to reconcile different schemas and regulations into a common semantic space, an Integrated Constraint Model (ICM) that compiles constraints into enforcement artifacts like GBNF, DFA, SHACL, and SMT, and Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation (CVG) for two-layer enforcement (structural and semantic) during artifact generation. PRISM also includes audit-guided repair and trace recording for compliance review.

Result: The paper's evaluation shows that PRISM successfully produces structurally valid and auditable artifacts in domains such as automotive software engineering (AUTOSAR) and cross-border legal jurisdiction (Brussels I bis). The results demonstrate that PRISM integrates with existing tooling and significantly reduces manual remediation efforts.

Conclusion: PRISM offers a practical approach to automated artifact generation in compliance-critical domains by combining LLMs with MDE, ensuring structural validity and reducing manual effort. It provides a foundation for future work on expanding its capabilities and exploring new application areas.

Abstract: PRISM unifies Large Language Models with Model-Driven Engineering to generate
regulator-ready artifacts and machine-checkable evidence for safety- and
compliance-critical domains. PRISM integrates three pillars: a Unified
Meta-Model (UMM) reconciles heterogeneous schemas and regulatory text into a
single semantic space; an Integrated Constraint Model (ICM) compiles structural
and semantic requirements into enforcement artifacts including generation-time
automata (GBNF, DFA) and post-generation validators (e.g., SHACL, SMT); and
Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation (CVG) applies these through two-layer
enforcement - structural constraints drive prefix-safe decoding while
semantic/logical validation produces machine-checkable certificates. When
violations occur, PRISM performs audit-guided repair and records generation
traces for compliance review. We evaluate PRISM in automotive software
engineering (AUTOSAR) and cross-border legal jurisdiction (Brussels I bis).
PRISM produces structurally valid, auditable artifacts that integrate with
existing tooling and substantially reduce manual remediation effort, providing
a practical path toward automated artifact generation with built-in assurance.

### [29] [Beyond Synthetic Benchmarks: Evaluating LLM Performance on Real-World Class-Level Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26130)
*Musfiqur Rahman,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A novel benchmark reveals that LLMs achieve 25-34% correctness in real-world class-level tasks (vs. 84-89%p in synthetic benchmarks). Retrieval-augmented generation with partial documentation improves performance by 4-7%, but critical errors like type/attribute mismatches persist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic benchmarks overestimate LLM capabilities for class-level engineering, and real-world performance gaps in practical conditions (codebase generalization, documentation integration) remain unstudied.

Method: Created a real-world class benchmark from open-source repositories with seen/unseen partitions; evaluated LLMs across input specs, retrieval-augmented setups, and documentation completeness levels (0-100%), measuring functional correctness and error patterns.

Result: LLMs show 0% generalization between familiar/new codebases. Comprehensive docs provide minimal (1-3pp) benefits. RAG with partial documentation reduces logical flaws but introduces dependency conflicts. Attribute/Type errors dominate 84%p of failures, with synthetic benchmarks overemphasizing assertion errors.

Conclusion: Exposes fundamental limitations in LLMs for class-level code engineering, requiring improvements in context modeling, documentation strategies, and retrieval integration to address real-world dependency/semantic mismatches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation at the function
level, yet their ability to produce correct class-level implementations in
authentic software projects remains poorly understood. This work introduces a
novel benchmark derived from open-source repositories, comprising real-world
classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization
under practical conditions. The evaluation examines multiple LLMs under varied
input specifications, retrieval-augmented configurations, and documentation
completeness levels.
  Results reveal a stark performance disparity: LLMs achieve 84% to 89%
correctness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on
real-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel
codebases. Comprehensive docstrings yield modest gains of 1% to 3% in
functional accuracy, though statistical significance is rare.
Retrieval-augmented generation proves most effective with partial
documentation, improving correctness by 4% to 7% by supplying concrete
implementation patterns absent from specifications. Error profiling identifies
AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes (84% of
cases), with synthetic tests overemphasizing assertion issues and real-world
scenarios highlighting type and attribute mismatches. Retrieval augmentation
reduces logical flaws but can introduce dependency conflicts.
  The benchmark and analysis expose critical limitations in current LLM
capabilities for class-level engineering, offering actionable insights for
enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval
integration in production code assistance tools.

### [30] [Reduction of Test Re-runs by Prioritizing Potential Order Dependent Flaky Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26171)
*Hasnain Iqbal,Zerina Begum,Kazi Sakib*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to prioritize potential order-dependent (OD) tests by analyzing shared static fields in test classes, which reduced unnecessary test executions and re-runs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flaky tests, particularly OD tests, can cause CI failures without indicating actual faults, and current methods for detecting/repairing OD tests require too many test re-runs, leading to high execution costs.

Method: The method analyzes shared static fields in test classes to identify tests more likely to be order-dependent. By prioritizing these tests first, the number of test executions and unnecessary re-runs can be significantly reduced.

Result: On 27 project modules, the proposed method successfully prioritized all OD tests in 23 cases, reducing test executions by 65.92% and unnecessary re-runs by 72.19%.

Conclusion: The approach effectively prioritizes potential OD tests through static field analysis, significantly improving detection efficiency and reducing execution costs, making it a valuable improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: Flaky tests can make automated software testing unreliable due to their
unpredictable behavior. These tests can pass or fail on the same code base on
multiple runs. However, flaky tests often do not refer to any fault, even
though they can cause the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to fail. A
common type of flaky test is the order-dependent (OD) test. The outcome of an
OD test depends on the order in which it is run with respect to other test
cases. Several studies have explored the detection and repair of OD tests.
However, their methods require re-runs of tests multiple times, that are not
related to the order dependence. Hence, prioritizing potential OD tests is
necessary to reduce the re-runs. In this paper, we propose a method to
prioritize potential order-dependent tests. By analyzing shared static fields
in test classes, we identify tests that are more likely to be order-dependent.
In our experiment on 27 project modules, our method successfully prioritized
all OD tests in 23 cases, reducing test executions by an average of 65.92% and
unnecessary re-runs by 72.19%. These results demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the efficiency of OD test detection by lowering
execution costs.

*Liming Dong,Sung Une Lee,Zhenchang Xing,Muhammad Ejaz Ahmed,Stefan Avgoustakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A review of software supply chain security practices in critical infrastructure, revealing gaps and introducing an 80-question checklist for stakeholders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing frequency and sophistication of software supply chain attacks pose significant risks to critical infrastructure sectors, necessitating a thorough understanding of existing security practices and their alignment with sector-specific needs.

Method: The paper conducts a multivocal literature review across international frameworks, Australian regulatory sources, and academic studies. It uses a '4W+1H' analytical approach to synthesize security practices across categories, life-cycle phases, stakeholder roles, and implementation levels.

Result: The analysis identifies ten core categories of security practices, maps them across '4W+1H' dimensions, and culminates in an 80-question checklist for stakeholders to evaluate and enhance their software supply chain security. Gaps between existing frameworks and CI sector needs are revealed.

Conclusion: There is a clear need for integrated, context-aware approaches to software supply chain security in critical infrastructure. The checklist provides a practical tool for stakeholders to address these gaps and protect against evolving threats.

Abstract: The increasing frequency and sophistication of software supply chain attacks
pose severe risks to critical infrastructure sectors, threatening national
security, economic stability, and public safety. Despite growing awareness,
existing security practices remain fragmented and insufficient, with most
frameworks narrowly focused on isolated life cycle stages or lacking alignment
with the specific needs of critical infrastructure (CI) sectors. In this paper,
we conducted a multivocal literature review across international frameworks,
Australian regulatory sources, and academic studies to identify and analyze
security practices across the software supply chain, especially specific CI
sector. Our analysis found that few existing frameworks are explicitly tailored
to CI domains. We systematically leveraged identified software supply chain
security frameworks, using a "4W+1H" analytical approach, we synthesized ten
core categories (what) of software supply chain security practices, mapped them
across life-cycle phases (when), stakeholder roles (who), and implementation
levels (how), and examined their coverage across existing frameworks (where).
Building on these insights, the paper culminates in structured, multi-layered
checklist of 80 questions designed to relevant stakeholders evaluate and
enhance their software supply chain security. Our findings reveal gaps between
framework guidance and sector-specific needs, highlight the need for
integrated, context-aware approaches to safeguard critical infrastructure from
evolving software supply chain risks.

*Domenico Amalfitano,Andreas Metzger,Marco Autili,Tommaso Fulcini,Tobias Hey,Jan Keim,Patrizio Pelliccione,Vincenzo Scotti,Anne Koziolek,Raffaela Mirandola,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a research roadmap for GenAI-augmented software engineering using design science research. It identifies four key augmentation forms, research challenges, and future directions, resulting in ten predictions through cross-validation of insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically address the transformative impact of Generative AI on software engineering practices and provide a structured framework for future research in this evolving domain.

Method: Design science research with three iterative cycles involving FSE 2025 workshop discussions, literature reviews, and peer feedback, using McLuhan's tetrads for conceptual analysis.

Result: A consolidated research roadmap featuring four fundamental GenAI augmentation forms, mapped research challenges and opportunities, and ten specific SE 2030 predictions verified through peer validation.

Conclusion: The rigorous multi-cycle approach establishes a transparent and reproducible foundation for understanding GenAI’s role in SE evolution, guiding future research and offering a validated framework for academic and industry adoption.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)
practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software
systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science
research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of
three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,
including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering
2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions
involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to
systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and
software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of
GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related
research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated
into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a
rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author
teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation
for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for
framing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these
findings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.

### [33] [Empowering RepoQA-Agent based on Reinforcement Learning Driven by Monte-carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26287)
*Guochang Li,Yuchen Liu,Zhen Qin,Yunkun Wang,Jianping Zhong,Chen Zhi,Binhua Li,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by Monte-carlo Tree Search is proposed for repository-level software engineering tasks, which addresses the limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches, whether training-free or training-based, have limitations in effective tool utilization, decision-making based on feedback, and data compliance in enterprise environments.

Method: RepoSearch-R1, a new agentic reinforcement learning framework powered by Monte-Carlo Tree Search, is introduced. It enables agents to generate diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without requiring model distillation or external supervision.

Result: RepoSearch-R1 achieves significant improvements in answer completeness (16.0% over no-retrieval methods and 19.5% over iterative retrieval methods) and training efficiency (33% increase compared to general agentic reinforcement learning methods).

Conclusion: The cold-start training methodology of RepoSearch-R1 effectively eliminates data compliance concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness in repository-level reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Repository-level software engineering tasks require large language models
(LLMs) to efficiently navigate and extract information from complex codebases
through multi-turn tool interactions. Existing approaches face significant
limitations: training-free, in-context learning methods struggle to guide
agents effectively in tool utilization and decision-making based on
environmental feedback, while training-based approaches typically rely on
costly distillation from larger LLMs, introducing data compliance concerns in
enterprise environments. To address these challenges, we introduce
RepoSearch-R1, a novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by
Monte-carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach allows agents to generate
diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without
requiring model distillation or external supervision. Based on RepoSearch-R1,
we construct a RepoQA-Agent specifically designed for repository
question-answering tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on repository
question-answering tasks demonstrates that RepoSearch-R1 achieves substantial
improvements of answer completeness: 16.0% enhancement over no-retrieval
methods, 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and 33% increase
in training efficiency compared to general agentic reinforcement learning
approaches. Our cold-start training methodology eliminates data compliance
concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness
across repository-level reasoning tasks.

### [34] [Environmental Impact of CI/CD Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26413)
*Nuno Saavedra,Alexandra Mendes,João F. Ferreira*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study analyzes the carbon and water footprint (CWF) of GitHub Actions usage in open-source projects, estimating potential CWF based on 2.2 million workflow runs, and proposes strategies to mitigate it through efficient runner deployment and policy changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a significant lack of transparency regarding the environmental impact of CI/CD pipelines, particularly their carbon and water footprints. As cloud computing's environmental footprint grows, quantifying the impact of CI/CD services like GitHub Actions is crucial for developers and the tech industry.

Method: The paper adapts the Cloud Carbon Footprint methodology to estimate the environmental impact of GitHub Actions. It utilizes a large dataset of over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000 repositories.

Result: The study results in CWF estimates for GitHub Actions in 2024. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water. These figures compare to the annual carbon capture by 7,615 urban trees and 5053 years of average American family water consumption. The analysis shows the substantial ecological impact of widespread CI/CD usage.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by identifying potential mitigation strategies for reducing the environmental impact of GitHub Actions. These include deploying runners in regions with green energy, aligning execution with favorable energy periods, enforcing stricter deactivation policies for scheduled workflows, and reducing repository sizes to minimize unnecessary computation.

Abstract: CI/CD pipelines are widely used in software development, yet their
environmental impact, particularly carbon and water footprints (CWF), remains
largely unknown to developers, as CI service providers typically do not
disclose such information. With the growing environmental impact of cloud
computing, understanding the CWF of CI/CD services has become increasingly
important.
  This work investigates the CWF of using GitHub Actions, focusing on
open-source repositories where usage is free and unlimited for standard
runners. We build upon a methodology from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework
and we use the largest dataset of workflow runs reported in the literature to
date, comprising over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000
repositories.
  Our analysis reveals that the GitHub Actions ecosystem results in a
substantial CWF. Our estimates for the carbon footprint in 2024 range from
150.5 MTCO2e in the most optimistic scenario to 994.9 MTCO2e in the most
pessimistic scenario, while the water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5
kiloliters. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon
footprint and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water footprint. To provide perspective,
the carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon
captured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable
to the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.
  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted
computational resources. Key recommendations include deploying runners in
regions whose energy production has a low environmental impact such as France
and the United Kingdom, implementing stricter deactivation policies for
scheduled runs and aligning their execution with periods when the regional
energy mix is more environmentally favorable, and reducing the size of
repositories.

### [35] [Nexus: Execution-Grounded Multi-Agent Test Oracle Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26423)
*Dong Huang,Mingzhe Du,Jie M. Zhang,Zheng Lin,Meng Luo,Qianru Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Nexus is a multi-agent framework for test oracle generation that improves accuracy through collaborative deliberation and iterative self-refinement, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test oracle generation remains a critical challenge in software engineering, as accurate oracles are essential for verifying function correctness in non-regression testing. Existing solutions fail to consistently balance accuracy, reliability, and adaptability.

Method: Nexus employs four specialist agents representing distinct testing philosophies to iteratively refine oracles through deliberation, validation against a sandboxed implementation, and runtime-error-driven self-refinement. This structured multi-stage process ensures systematic error correction and optimization.

Result: Evaluations show Nexus achieves 57.73"% oracle accuracy (vs. 46.30"% for GPT-4.1-Mini on LiveCodeBench), 95.45"% bug detection rate (up from 90.91"% on HumanEval), and 69.32"% automated repair success (vs. 35.23"%) compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Nexus demonstrates that multi-agent collaboration combined with iterative self-refinement significantly enhances test oracle accuracy and downstream testing effectiveness, establishing a new benchmark for oracle generation in software testing.

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

*Mihály Dobos-Kovács,Levente Bajczi,András Vörös*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver using software verification tools, showing moderate success in linear integer arithmetic and modest success in bitvector benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are essential for verification tasks. However, existing CHC solvers may not effectively handle complexities like bitvectors and low-level semantics, which motivated the development of a new solver that leverages mature software verification tools.

Method: The researchers developed CHCVERIF, which utilizes a portfolio-based approach to leverage existing software verification tools for solving CHC benchmarks. This method integrates tools designed for software verification to handle challenging aspects of CHCs.

Result: CHCVERIF showed moderate success with linear integer arithmetic and modest success with bitvector benchmarks. It validated the approach's potential when combined with a thoughtfully curated portfolio of solvers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that using software verification tools with a well-structured portfolio for CHC solving is viable and holds significant potential for tackling complex benchmarks, encouraging further exploration and integration of existing tools.

Abstract: Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are widely adopted as intermediate
representations for a variety of verification tasks, including safety checking,
invariant synthesis, and interprocedural analysis. This paper introduces
CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver that adopts a software verification
approach for solving CHCs. This approach enables us to reuse mature software
verification tools to tackle CHC benchmarks, particularly those involving
bitvectors and low-level semantics. Our evaluation shows that while the method
enjoys only moderate success with linear integer arithmetic, it achieves modest
success on bitvector benchmarks. Moreover, our results demonstrate the
viability and potential of using software verification tools as backends for
CHC solving, particularly when supported by a carefully constructed portfolio.

*Fang Liu,Simiao Liu,Yinghao Zhu,Xiaoli Lian,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: To streamline the generation of code review comments, this paper proposes SecureReviewer, a new approach that fine-tunes LLMs with a security-focused dataset and a new evaluation metric, SecureBLEU. Experimental results outperform existing models in identifying security issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 
1. Identifying and addressing security issues during the early development phase is crucial for mitigating long-term negative impacts on software systems.
2. Existing LLM-based code review models focus on general code review, lacking exploration in security issue detection.
3. Adapting code review practices to target security faces substantial challenges, specifically data scarcity and inadequate evaluation metrics.

Method: 
1. Construct a dataset tailored for security code review.
2. Fine-tune LLMs with a security-aware strategy to detect security issues and provide fixes.
3. Integrate RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to reduce hallucinations and enhance reliability.
4. Propose SecureBLEU, a new metric, to evaluate the effectiveness of security issue addressing in review comments.

Result: SecureReviewer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in security issue detection accuracy and the practical utility of generated review comments, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SecureReviewer, enhanced by a security-specific dataset and SecureBLEU metric, effectively supports security issue detection in code reviews and suggests directions for future exploration in secure code review practices.

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates open-source LLMs for automating Extract Method Refactoring in Python code, comparing one-shot prompting and Recursive Criticism and Improvement. Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI perform best, with high test pass rates and code quality improvements. Developer surveys and benchmarks are shared.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating Extract Method Refactoring (EMR) is challenging yet crucial for code readability and maintainability. Recent advancements in open-source, resource-efficient LLMs offer new opportunities for automating such tasks.

Method: The study evaluates five state-of-the-art open-source LLMs (3B-8B parameters) on EMR for Python code. It assesses functional correctness and code quality using automated metrics and compares one-shot prompting with Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI) strategies. Developer surveys and a benchmark are used to evaluate the results.

Result: RCI-based prompting outperforms one-shot prompting in test pass rates and refactoring quality. Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI achieve high test pass percentages (0.829 and 0.808) and reduce lines of code and cyclomatic complexity. Developer surveys show over 70% acceptance of RCI-generated refactorings, with Qwen2.5-Coder being top-rated. Original code scored poorly in readability and maintainability.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that automated refactoring with LLMs, especially using RCI prompting, shows significant potential for improving code quality. Human evaluation is essential, as traditional metrics may not align perfectly with human judgments. The open-source benchmark supports future research in this area.

Abstract: Automating the Extract Method refactoring (EMR) remains challenging and
largely manual despite its importance in improving code readability and
maintainability. Recent advances in open-source, resource-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer promising new approaches for automating such
high-level tasks. In this work, we critically evaluate five state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, spanning 3B to 8B parameter sizes, on the EMR task for Python
code. We systematically assess functional correctness and code quality using
automated metrics and investigate the impact of prompting strategies by
comparing one-shot prompting to a Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI)
approach. RCI-based prompting consistently outperforms one-shot prompting in
test pass rates and refactoring quality. The best-performing models,
Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI, achieve test pass percentage (TPP)
scores of 0.829 and 0.808, while reducing lines of code (LOC) per method from
12.103 to 6.192 and 5.577, and cyclomatic complexity (CC) from 4.602 to 3.453
and 3.294, respectively. A developer survey on RCI-generated refactorings shows
over 70% acceptance, with Qwen2.5-Coder rated highest across all evaluation
criteria. In contrast, the original code scored below neutral, particularly in
readability and maintainability, underscoring the benefits of automated
refactoring guided by quality prompts. While traditional metrics like CC and
LOC provide useful signals, they often diverge from human judgments,
emphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Our open-source
benchmark offers a foundation for future research on automated refactoring with
LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Instruct4Edit, a data generation pipeline using LLMs to create a high-quality fine-tuning dataset for web editing. This leads to improved performance in translating human instructions into accurate code changes, and provides a scalable foundation for NLP-based web editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for web editing via LLMs lack a large-scale, high-quality tuning dataset, making it challenging to align model performance with human expectations.

Method: The proposed method generates diverse instructions, applies code modifications, and performs visual verification to ensure correctness. Instruct4Edit is the resulting dataset from this automated pipeline.

Result: Fine-tuning models on Instruct4Edit shows consistent improvement in translating human intent into precise, structurally coherent, and visually accurate code changes. Smaller open-source models achieve competitive performance with proprietary systems.

Conclusion: Instruct4Edit provides a scalable and transparent foundation for natural language-based web editing, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning smaller open-source models to match proprietary systems.

Abstract: The evolution of web applications relies on iterative code modifications, a
process that is traditionally manual and time-consuming. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) can generate UI code, their ability to edit existing code from
new design requirements (e.g., "center the logo") remains a challenge. This is
largely due to the absence of large-scale, high-quality tuning data to align
model performance with human expectations. In this paper, we introduce a novel,
automated data generation pipeline that uses LLMs to synthesize a high-quality
fine-tuning dataset for web editing, named Instruct4Edit. Our approach
generates diverse instructions, applies the corresponding code modifications,
and performs visual verification to ensure correctness. By fine-tuning models
on Instruct4Edit, we demonstrate consistent improvement in translating human
intent into precise, structurally coherent, and visually accurate code changes.
This work provides a scalable and transparent foundation for natural language
based web editing, demonstrating that fine-tuning smaller open-source models
can achieve competitive performance with proprietary systems. We release all
data, code implementations, and model checkpoints for reproduction.

TL;DR: ZKMLOps uses zero-knowledge proofs in MLOps to provide verifiable compliance without revealing sensitive information, evaluated in financial risk auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring AI system trustworthiness and legal compliance with high auditability requirements while protecting confidential data and proprietary models.

Method: The proposed ZKMLOps framework integrates zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) with established software engineering patterns, creating a modular and repeatable process for generating cryptographic compliance proofs.

Result: The framework's practicality was demonstrated through a case study on financial risk auditing and an empirical evaluation of top ZKP protocols, showing their feasibility for various ML complexities.

Conclusion: ZKMLOps offers a novel solution to balance legal compliance with data protection in AI systems by operationalizing ZKPs within machine-learning operations lifecycles.

Abstract: The increasing exploitation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems
in critical domains has made trustworthiness concerns a paramount showstopper,
requiring verifiable accountability, often by regulation (e.g., the EU AI Act).
Classical software verification and validation techniques, such as procedural
audits, formal methods, or model documentation, are the mechanisms used to
achieve this. However, these methods are either expensive or heavily manual and
ill-suited for the opaque, "black box" nature of most AI models. An intractable
conflict emerges: high auditability and verifiability are required by law, but
such transparency conflicts with the need to protect assets being audited-e.g.,
confidential data and proprietary models-leading to weakened accountability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces ZKMLOps, a novel MLOps
verification framework that operationalizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs
(ZKPs)-cryptographic protocols allowing a prover to convince a verifier that a
statement is true without revealing additional information-within
Machine-Learning Operations lifecycles. By integrating ZKPs with established
software engineering patterns, ZKMLOps provides a modular and repeatable
process for generating verifiable cryptographic proof of compliance. We
evaluate the framework's practicality through a study of regulatory compliance
in financial risk auditing and assess feasibility through an empirical
evaluation of top ZKP protocols, analyzing performance trade-offs for ML models
of increasing complexity.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Introduces a novel Bayesian inference debugging approach for probabilistic programming, reducing time and knowledge requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic programming is hard to debug; practitioners spend significant time and require deep knowledge for inference issues.

Method: Discussing requirements for a debugging framework and proposing a new tool integrated into the development environment.

Result: 18 participant study demonstrated reduced time and difficulty for inference debugging tasks.

Conclusion: The approach allows efficient and interactive debugging, making Bayesian inference more accessible.

Abstract: Probabilistic programming is a rapidly developing programming paradigm which
enables the formulation of Bayesian models as programs and the automation of
posterior inference. It facilitates the development of models and conducting
Bayesian inference, which makes these techniques available to practitioners
from multiple fields. Nevertheless, probabilistic programming is notoriously
difficult as identifying and repairing issues with inference requires a lot of
time and deep knowledge. Through this work, we introduce a novel approach to
debugging Bayesian inference that reduces time and required knowledge
significantly. We discuss several requirements a Bayesian inference debugging
framework has to fulfill, and propose a new tool that meets these key
requirements directly within the development environment. We evaluate our
results in a study with 18 experienced participants and show that our approach
to online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference significantly reduces
time and difficulty on inference debugging tasks.

Motivation: Although block-based environments reduce syntax errors in programming education, semantic bugs persist, and direct-answer debugging methods often fail to foster problem-solving skills.

Method: Stitch employs a Diff-Analyze module to compare learners' projects with reference implementations, pinpoint significant differences, and provide explanations with the aid of a large language model, allowing iterative partial fixes.

Result: Empirical studies show that Stitch's step-by-step approach enhances learning outcomes compared to direct-answer methods and automated feedback generation tools, with the system outperforming them both.

Conclusion: Step-by-step interactive debugging promotes better learning, but the ideal form for effective feedback in block-based programming is still an open research topic.

Abstract: Block-based environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in
programming education. While block syntax reduces surface errors, semantic bugs
remain common and challenging for novices to resolve. Existing debugging
workflows typically show the correct program directly to learners, a strategy
that may fix errors but undermines the development of problem-solving skills.
  We present Stitch, an interactive tutoring system that replaces "showing the
answer" with step-by-step scaffolding. The system's Diff-Analyze module
contrasts a student's project with a reference implementation, identifies the
most critical differences, and uses a large language model to explain why these
changes matter. Learners inspect highlighted blocks through a custom rendering
engine, understand the explanations, and selectively apply partial fixes. This
iterative process continues until the intended functionality is achieved.
  We evaluate Stitch in an empirical study, comparing it against a
state-of-the-art automated feedback generation tool for Scratch. Our key
insight is that simply presenting the correct program is pedagogically
ineffective. In contrast, our interactive, step-by-step guided system promotes
a more effective learning experience. More broadly, what constitutes effective
feedback in block-based programming remains an open question. Our evaluation
provides new evidence that step-by-step tutoring significantly enhances
learning outcomes, outperforming both direct-answer approaches and current
automated feedback generation tools.

### [44] [Process-based Indicators of Vulnerability Re-Introducing Code Changes: An Exploratory Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26676)
*Samiha Shimmi,Nicholas M. Synovic,Mona Rahimi,George K. Thiruvathukal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how process metrics (e.g., bus factor, issue density) combined with code changes can reveal patterns leading to software vulnerability reintroduction, using a case study of 76 instances in ImageMagick.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies rarely explore temporal patterns in process metrics for anticipating vulnerability reintroduction, despite evidence that vulnerabilities often result from cumulative socio-technical factors.

Method: Analyzes security fixes at the commit level in ImageMagick using longitudinal process metrics (bus factor, issue density, issue spoilage), focusing on 76 reintroduced vulnerabilities rather than file-level predictions.

Result: Reintroduced vulnerabilities correlate with increased issue spoilage and fluctuating issue density, indicating short-term inefficiencies in issue management and team responsiveness.

Conclusion: Combining process metrics with code metrics can improve prediction of risky fixes, offering a foundation for mitigating vulnerabilities through socio-technical context analysis.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities often persist or re-emerge even after being fixed,
revealing the complex interplay between code evolution and socio-technical
factors. While source code metrics provide useful indicators of
vulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that
lead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process
metrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are
essential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work
highlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in
understanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond
file-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level,
focusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also
on the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and
re-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of
one isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and
socio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study
on the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as
bus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction
activities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our
findings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage
and fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue
management and team responsiveness. These observations provide a foundation for
broader studies that combine process and code metrics to predict risky fixes
and strengthen software security.

### [45] [Using Copilot Agent Mode to Automate Library Migration: A Quantitative Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26699)
*Aylton Almeida,Laerte Xavier,Marco Tulio Valente*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Copilot Agent Mode in migrating SQLAlchemy from versions 1.x to 2.0 by analyzing ten client apps, using Migration Coverage as a metric. The LLM agent achieved 100% median migration coverage but only 39.75% median post-migration test-pass rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research is motivated by the persistent challenges in manually maintaining and updating complex libraries like SQLAlchemy, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Automated methods are crucial for managing technical debt, security risks, and system rigidity.

Method: The approach involves running the GitHub Copilot Agent Mode on a dataset of ten applications using SQLAlchemy 1.x to handle the update process from version 1.x to 2.0. The primary performance indicator is Migration Coverage, which measures the percentage of accurately updated API points.

Result: The outcomes revealed the LLM agent successfully migrated API usages with 100% median coverage but faced significant challenges in preserving application functionality, resulting in a median test-pass rate of 39.75%.

Conclusion: While the LLM-based agent effectively covered all migration areas, it did not guarantee successful application function, emphasizing the need for further development in ensuring functional correctness despite comprehensive API updates.

Abstract: Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt,
security vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However,
updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone
process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding
systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this
paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy,
across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's
Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing
multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated
migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the
proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study
show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages
between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to
maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate
(39.75%, median).

### [46] [Optimized Log Parsing with Syntactic Modifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26793)
*Nafid Enan,Gias Uddin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates different log parsing methods and introduces SynLog+, a module that enhances parsing accuracy in a two-phase architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Log parsing is crucial for converting semi-structured logs into structured data, but the diverse range of methods and architectures necessitates a comprehensive evaluation.

Method: The study compares syntax- and semantic-based log parsers using single-phase and two-phase architectures through empirical experiments.

Result: Semantic-based methods excel in template identification, while syntax-based parsers are more efficient. Two-phase architectures improve accuracy. SynLog+ boosts accuracy by 236% for syntax-based and 20% for semantic-based methods with minimal runtime cost.

Conclusion: The study advocates for two-phase log parsing architectures and introduces SynLog+ as an effective and efficient enhancement for both syntax- and semantic-based log parsers.

Abstract: Logs provide valuable insights into system runtime and assist in software
development and maintenance. Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log
data into structured log data, is often the first step in automated log
analysis. Given the wide range of log parsers utilizing diverse techniques, it
is essential to evaluate them to understand their characteristics and
performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study
comparing syntax- and semantic-based log parsers, as well as single-phase and
two-phase parsing architectures. Our experiments reveal that semantic-based
methods perform better at identifying the correct templates and syntax-based
log parsers are 10 to 1,000 times more efficient and provide better grouping
accuracy although they fall short in accurate template identification.
Moreover, two-phase architecture consistently improves accuracy compared to
single-phase architecture. Based on the findings of this study, we propose
SynLog+, a template identification module that acts as the second phase in a
two-phase log parsing architecture. SynLog+ improves the parsing accuracy of
syntax-based and semantic-based log parsers by 236\% and 20\% on average,
respectively, with virtually no additional runtime cost.
