We present\nHierarchical Multi-Modal Threat Intelligence Fusion (HM-TIF), a framework\nexplicitly designed for this realistic scenario where naturally aligned\nmulti-modal attack data does not exist. Unlike prior work that assumes or\ncreates artificial alignment, we develop principled methods for correlating\nindependent security data streams while maintaining operational validity. Our\narchitecture employs hierarchical cross-attention with dynamic weighting that\nadapts to data availability and threat context, coupled with a novel temporal\ncorrelation protocol that preserves statistical independence. Evaluation on\nUNSW-NB15, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and CICBell-DNS2021 datasets demonstrates that\nHM-TIF achieves 88.7% accuracy with a critical 32% reduction in false positive\nrates, even without true multi-modal training data. The framework maintains\nrobustness when modalities are missing, making it immediately deployable in\nreal security operations where data streams frequently have gaps. Our\ncontributions include: (i) the first multi-modal security framework explicitly\ndesigned for non-aligned data, (ii) a temporal correlation protocol that avoids\ncommon data leakage pitfalls, (iii) empirical validation that multi-modal\nfusion provides operational benefits even without perfect alignment, and (iv)\npractical deployment guidelines for security teams facing heterogeneous,\nuncoordinated data sources.

Existing multi-modal threat detection frameworks assume alignment, which is not typical in real-world operations, leading to operational invalidity.", "method": "HM-TIF employs hierarchical cross-attention with dynamic weighting to adapt to varying data availability and threat context, and features a temporal correlation protocol that maintains the statistical independence of the data. The framework can function even with missing modalities or data gaps.", "result": "Evaluation on three datasets (UNSW-NB15, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CICBell-DNS2021) shows HM-TIF achieved 88.7% accuracy and a 32% reduction in false positives, compared to existing methods and without requiring aligned multi-modal training data.", "conclusion": "The HM-TIF framework provides a practical and effective solution for multi-modal threat detection in real-world scenarios with unaligned data, demonstrating the operational benefits of such an approach and offering deployment guidelines for security teams dealing with heterogeneous and uncoordinated data sources."}}
