We will conduct a\nconfirmatory study across eight real-world mesh-processing AI systems,\ncomparing GRAphRef with AFL, MeshAttack, Saffron, and two ablated variants.\nEvaluation metrics include structural validity, semantic preservation (via\nprediction consistency), and performance overhead.

However, optimizations for\nfitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on\nhistorical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been\nexercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would\nhinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,\nwe propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine\nhistorical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via\nan optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF\nas a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition\nsequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,\nand the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence\nindicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to\npredict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural\nnetworks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually\nimitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions\nthat have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a\nReinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition\nsequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine\nhistorical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path\ntransition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of\nfuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we\npropose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the\ncritical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target\nefficiently."}

Current vulnerability datasets suffer\nfrom issues including label inaccuracy rates of 20-71%, extensive duplication,\nand poor coverage of critical CWE types. These issues create a significant\n\"generalization gap\" where models achieve misleading self-testing performance\n(measured on held-out data from same dataset for training) by exploiting\nspurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns. Our\nanalysis reveals that many models experience substantial performance drops of\nup to 40.6% when evaluated on independent data, sometimes underperforming\nrandom guessing.\n  To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we\nintroduce a manually curated test dataset, BenchVul, covering the MITRE Top 25\nMost Dangerous CWEs. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset,\nTitanVul, comprising 35,045 functions by aggregating seven public sources and\napplying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM framework.\nThird, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) framework, which\nsynthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but\ncritical CWE types through simulated development workflows.\n  Our evaluation shows the strengths of each component in closing the\ngeneralization gap. First, BenchVul shows the limitations of self-testing:\nmodels trained on existing datasets, such as BigVul and PrimeVul, experience\nperformance drops on BenchVul (from 0.776 to 0.519 and from 0.567 to 0.337).\nSecond, training models on TitanVul demonstrates improved generalization, with\nmodel performance increasing from 0.584 when evaluated on the same dataset to\n0.767 when tested on BenchVul. Third, supplementing TitanVul with RVG-generated\ndata yields further gains, increasing model performance by 14.0% to 0.874."}

However, these logs often contain\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII), raising significant privacy concerns\nwhen shared or analyzed. A key challenge in log anonymization is balancing\nprivacy protection with the retention of sufficient structure for meaningful\nanalysis. Overly aggressive anonymization can destroy contextual integrity,\nwhile weak techniques risk re-identification through linkage or inference\nattacks. This paper introduces novel field-specific anonymization methods that\naddress this trade-off. For IP addresses, we propose a salt-based hashing\ntechnique applied at the per-octet level, preserving both subnet and host\nstructure to enable correlation across various log entries while ensuring\nnon-reversibility. For port numbers, full-value hashing with range mapping\nmaintains interpretability. We also present an order-preserving timestamp\nanonymization scheme using adaptive noise injection, which obfuscates exact\ntimes without disrupting event sequences. An open-source tool implementing\nthese techniques has been released to support practical deployment and\nreproducible research. Evaluations using entropy metrics, collision rates, and\nresidual leakage analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively\nprotects privacy while preserving analytical utility."}

One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak\ninputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit\nunintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such\nunsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of\ntraining samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,\nexisting guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security\nconstraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.\nTraditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses\nharmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we\npropose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack\ntraining method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two\nmodules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using\nreinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker\nidentifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak\ndata. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to\naddress identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms\nused for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on\ncomplex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.\nAdditionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's\nover-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data\ngenerated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while\npreserving general performance."}
