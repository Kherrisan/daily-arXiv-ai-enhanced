In light of the above, this work proposes\na dynamic and decentralised blockchain management mechanism based on digital\ntwins. To ensure decentralisation, the proposed mechanism utilises multiple\ndigital twins that the system's stakeholders control. To facilitate\ndecentralised decision-making, the twins are organised in a secondary\nblockchain system that orchestrates agreement on, and propagation of decisions\nto the managed blockchain. This enables the management of blockchain systems\nwithout centralised control. A preliminary evaluation of the performance and\nimpact of the overheads introduced by the proposed mechanism is conducted\nthrough simulation. The results demonstrate the proposed mechanism's ability to\nreach consensus on decisions quickly and reconfigure the primary blockchain\nwith minimal overhead."}

Unintended Risk Interactions Induced by LLM Defenses", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various\napplications, but their deployment in sensitive domains raises significant\nconcerns. To mitigate these risks, numerous defense strategies have been\nproposed. However, most existing studies assess these defenses in isolation,\noverlooking their broader impacts across other risk dimensions. In this work,\nwe take the first step in investigating unintended interactions caused by\ndefenses in LLMs, focusing on the complex interplay between safety, fairness,\nand privacy. Specifically, we propose CrossRiskEval, a comprehensive evaluation\nframework to assess whether deploying a defense targeting one risk\ninadvertently affects others. Through extensive empirical studies on 14\ndefense-deployed LLMs, covering 12 distinct defense strategies, we reveal\nseveral alarming side effects: 1) safety defenses may suppress direct responses\nto sensitive queries related to bias or privacy, yet still amplify indirect\nprivacy leakage or biased outputs; 2) fairness defenses increase the risk of\nmisuse and privacy leakage; 3) privacy defenses often impair safety and\nexacerbate bias. We further conduct a fine-grained neuron-level analysis to\nuncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Our analysis reveals the\nexistence of conflict-entangled neurons in LLMs that exhibit opposing\nsensitivities across multiple risk dimensions. Further trend consistency\nanalysis at both task and neuron levels confirms that these neurons play a key\nrole in mediating the emergence of unintended behaviors following defense\ndeployment. We call for a paradigm shift in LLM risk evaluation, toward\nholistic, interaction-aware assessment of defense strategies."}

This study investigates emerging machine\nlearning models and training strategies to improve AI-based intrusion detection\nsystems (IDS) for ADS-B. Focusing on ground-based ATM systems, we evaluate two\ndeep learning IDS implementations: one using a transformer encoder and the\nother an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network, marking the first\nxLSTM-based IDS for ADS-B. A transfer learning strategy was employed, involving\npre-training on benign ADS-B messages and fine-tuning with labeled data\ncontaining instances of tampered messages. Results show this approach\noutperforms existing methods, particularly in identifying subtle attacks that\nprogressively undermine situational awareness. The xLSTM-based IDS achieves an\nF1-score of 98.9%, surpassing the transformer-based model at 94.3%. Tests on\nunseen attacks validated the generalization ability of the xLSTM model.\nInference latency analysis shows that the 7.26-second delay introduced by the\nxLSTM-based IDS fits within the Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) refresh\ninterval (5-12 s), although it may be restrictive for time-critical operations.\nWhile the transformer-based IDS achieves a 2.1-second latency, it does so at\nthe cost of lower detection performance."}

However, because only basic operations can be\nperformed on ciphertexts, programs must be expressed as boolean or arithmetic\ncircuits. This low-level representation makes implementing applications for FHE\nsignificantly more cumbersome than writing code in a high-level language. To\nreduce this burden, several transpilers have been developed that translate\nhigh-level code into circuit representations. In this work, we extend the range\nof high-level languages that can target FHE by introducing a transpiler for\nHaskell, which converts Haskell programs into Boolean circuits suitable for\nhomomorphic evaluation. Our second contribution is the automatic\nparallelization of these generated circuits. We implement an evaluator that\nexecutes gates in parallel by parallelizing each layer of the circuit. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two key applications: Private\nInformation Retrieval (PIR) and the AES encryption standard. Prior work has\nparallelized AES encryption manually. We demonstrate that the automated method\noutperforms some but not all manual parallelizations of AES evaluations under\nFHE.

Provenance\ncollection is often incorporated into the reference monitor of systems to\nensure that an audit trail exists of all events, that events are completely\ncaptured, and that logging of such events cannot be bypassed. However, recent\nresearch has questioned whether existing state-of-the-art provenance collection\nsystems fail to ensure the security guarantees of a true reference monitor due\nto the 'super producer threat' in which provenance generation can overload a\nsystem to force the system to drop security-relevant events and allow an\nattacker to hide their actions. One approach towards solving this threat is to\nenforce resource isolation, but that does not fully solve the problems\nresulting from hardware dependencies and performance limitations.\n  In this paper, we show how an operating system's kernel scheduler can\nmitigate this threat, and we introduce Venus, a learned scheduler for Linux\nspecifically designed for provenance. Unlike conventional schedulers that\nignore provenance completeness requirements, Venus leverages reinforcement\nlearning to learn provenance task behavior and to dynamically optimize resource\nallocation. We evaluate Venus's efficacy and show that Venus significantly\nimproves both the completeness and efficiency of provenance collection systems\ncompared to traditional scheduling, while maintaining reasonable overheads and\neven improving overall runtime in certain cases compared to the default Linux\nscheduler."}
