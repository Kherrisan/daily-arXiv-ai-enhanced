Abstract: The expansion of edge computing has increased the attack surface, creating an
urgent need for robust, real-time machine learning (ML)-based host intrusion
detection systems (HIDS) that balance accuracy and efficiency. In such
settings, inference latency poses a critical security risk, as delays may
provide exploitable opportunities for attackers. However, many state-of-the-art
ML-based HIDS solutions rely on computationally intensive architectures with
high inference costs, limiting their practical deployment. This paper proposes
LIGHT-HIDS, a lightweight machine learning framework that combines a compressed
neural network feature extractor trained via Deep Support Vector Data
Description (DeepSVDD) with an efficient novelty detection model. This hybrid
approach enables the learning of compact, meaningful representations of normal
system call behavior for accurate anomaly detection. Experimental results on
multiple datasets demonstrate that LIGHT-HIDS consistently enhances detection
accuracy while reducing inference time by up to 75x compared to
state-of-the-art methods. These findings highlight its effectiveness and
scalability as a machine learning-based solution for real-time host intrusion
detection.

### [2] [Practitioners' Perspectives on a Differential Privacy Deployment Registry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13509)
*Priyanka Nanayakkara,Elena Ghazi,Salil Vadhan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a registry for differential privacy (DP) deployments to facilitate knowledge sharing and accountability. It introduces a hierarchical schema, an interactive interface, and provides real-world deployment examples. A user study (n=16) highlights opportunities and challenges for adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP requires critical implementation decisions impacting privacy/utility. Dwork et al. (2019) suggested a public registry to improve shared learning and accountability. The paper addresses the need for a structured way to document and analyze DP deployments.

Method: The authors developed (1) a hierarchical schema for describing DP deployments, (2) an interactive registry interface, (3) populated it with 21 real-world deployments, and (4) conducted an exploratory user study with 16 DP practitioners.

Result: The user study found practitioners enthusiastic about the registry's value for evaluating past deployments and planning future ones. Identified opportunities include serving as a community hub and fostering interdepartmental communication (e.g., legal teams). Challenges include adoption barriers due to costs/risk of public disclosure and quality moderation.

Conclusion: The authors offer recommendations to enhance registry adoption and value, emphasizing support for DP practitioners, policymakers, data users, and data subjects. The registry is positioned as a critical resource to advance DP practices through transparency and community collaboration.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) -- a principled approach to producing statistical
data products with strong, mathematically provable privacy guarantees for the
individuals in the underlying dataset -- has seen substantial adoption in
practice over the past decade. Applying DP requires making several
implementation decisions, each with significant impacts on data privacy and/or
utility. Hence, to promote shared learning and accountability around DP
deployments, Dwork, Kohli, and Mulligan (2019) proposed a public-facing
repository ("registry") of DP deployments. The DP community has recently
started to work toward realizing this vision. We contribute to this effort by
(1) developing a holistic, hierarchical schema to describe any given DP
deployment and (2) designing and implementing an interactive interface to act
as a registry where practitioners can access information about past DP
deployments. We (3) populate our interface with 21 real-world DP deployments
and (4) conduct an exploratory user study with DP practitioners ($n=16$) to
understand how they would use the registry, as well as what challenges and
opportunities they foresee around its adoption. We find that participants were
enthusiastic about the registry as a valuable resource for evaluating prior
deployments and making future deployments. They also identified several
opportunities for the registry, including that it can become a "hub" for the
community and support broader communication around DP (e.g., to legal teams).
At the same time, they identified challenges around the registry gaining
adoption, including the effort and risk involved with making implementation
choices public and moderating the quality of entries. Based on our findings, we
offer recommendations for encouraging adoption and increasing the registry's
value not only to DP practitioners, but also to policymakers, data users, and
data subjects.

### [3] [AQUA-LLM: Evaluating Accuracy, Quantization, and Adversarial Robustness Trade-offs in LLMs for Cybersecurity Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13514)
*Onat Gungor,Roshan Sood,Harold Wang,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AQUA-LLM is an evaluation framework showing that combining quantization with fine-tuning optimizes accuracy, robustness, and efficiency for cybersecurity QA LLMs on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' computational demands hinder edge deployment, while quantization reduces accuracy and robustness, necessitating strategies to balance efficiency, accuracy, and security in cybersecurity QA.

Method: Benchmarked four LLM configurations (base, quantized-only, fine-tuned, quantized + fine-tuned using AQUA-LLM framework) for cybersecurity QA tasks on small LLMs.

Result: Quantization alone reduces accuracy/robustness but improves efficiency; combining with fine-tuning maintains high robustness and accuracy while preserving efficiency.

Conclusion: Quantization-aware, robustness-preserving fine-tuning is critical for deploying efficient and secure LLMs in resource-constrained cybersecurity environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential for
cybersecurity question answering (QA), supporting decision-making in real-time
threat detection and response workflows. However, their substantial
computational demands pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. Quantization, a widely adopted model
compression technique, can alleviate these constraints. Nevertheless,
quantization may degrade model accuracy and increase susceptibility to
adversarial attacks. Fine-tuning offers a potential means to mitigate these
limitations, but its effectiveness when combined with quantization remains
insufficiently explored. Hence, it is essential to understand the trade-offs
among accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. We propose AQUA-LLM, an evaluation
framework designed to benchmark several state-of-the-art small LLMs under four
distinct configurations: base, quantized-only, fine-tuned, and fine-tuned
combined with quantization, specifically for cybersecurity QA. Our results
demonstrate that quantization alone yields the lowest accuracy and robustness
despite improving efficiency. In contrast, combining quantization with
fine-tuning enhances both LLM robustness and predictive performance, achieving
an optimal balance of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. These findings
highlight the critical need for quantization-aware, robustness-preserving
fine-tuning methodologies to enable the robust and efficient deployment of LLMs
for cybersecurity QA.

### [4] [GuardianPWA: Enhancing Security Throughout the Progressive Web App Installation Lifecycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13561)
*Mengxiao Wang,Guofei Gu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces GUARDIANPWA to secure PWA installations via CIA principles. It identifies 203 security gaps in browsers, highlights vendor responses, and empowers developers to create secure PWAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PWAs bridge web and mobile app functionalities but face critical security challenges during installation. The paper addresses the lack of adherence to CIA principles in browsers, which risks user privacy, integrity, and confidentiality.

Method: The GUARDIANPWA framework evaluates the PWA installation process against the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) security principles. It analyzes manifest files for correctness, identifies non-compliance with security protocols, and offers actionable recommendations.

Result: The study discovered 203 non-compliance instances across browsers. Specific issues include Firefox’s private-mode leakage and Samsung Internet’s lack of origin visibility. Fixes were initiated by vendors, with Firefox resolving one issue and planning to address two more.

Conclusion: GUARDIANPWA provides a structured approach to enhance PWA installation security by addressing identified vulnerabilities. It supports developers in aligning PWAs with CIA principles, thus improving user trust and privacy.

Abstract: Progressive Web App (PWA) installation is critical for integrating web and
mobile app functionalities, offering a seamless user experience. However,
ensuring the security of the PWA installation lifecycle is essential for
maintaining user trust and privacy. This paper introduces the GUARDIANPWA
framework, a comprehensive approach to analyzing the PWA installation mechanism
based on the CIA security principles (Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability) and identifying areas where browser vendors fail to comply with
these principles. Our study revealed 203 instances of non-compliance with
security principles, highlighting how these irregularities in the PWA
installation lifecycle can lead to potential violations of user privacy. For
instance, in Firefox, PWAs installed in private mode incorrectly appear in
normal mode, risking user confidentiality. Additionally, 29,465 PWAs are at
risk because Samsung Internet does not display origins when PWAs navigate to
third-party websites, undermining integrity. These findings were reported to
browser vendors, leading to Firefox acknowledging four issues, resolving one,
and planning to resolve two others. GUARDIANPWA supports developers by
analyzing PWA manifest files for syntactic and semantic correctness, offering
actionable recommendations, and helping to create PWAs that align with security
best practices. By using GUARDIANPWA, developers and users can address critical
security gaps and enhance compliance with CIA principles throughout the PWA
installation lifecycle.

### [5] [Demystifying Progressive Web Application Permission Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13563)
*Mengxiao Wang,Guofei Gu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study identifies inconsistent and incomplete permission management in PWAs, leading to security risks and proposing a unified permission model with actionable solutions through cross-platform analysis and collaborative fixes with browsers like Firefox and Chrome.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are adopting system-level capabilities but lack a cohesive permission management framework, leaving them vulnerable to potential security issues, which makes understanding and addressing these permission flaws crucial.

Method: The research deployed Permissioner, a cross-platform analysis tool, to evaluate PWA permissions systematically. They identified inconsistencies, analyzed the reasons certain browsers avoid granular permissions, aiming to uncover vulnerabilities and underlying challenges in permission enforcement.

Result: The study found critical PWA permission issues, illustrating vulnerabilities through attacks like permission leakage, device identification, and API abuse. Key outcomes include acknowledged and resolved permissions problems with Firefox and Chrome, based on the research insights.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a unified, robust permission model for PWAs is essential and provides actionable guidance for implementing effective solutions after system analysis and working with browser vendors.

Abstract: Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) blend the advantages of web and native
apps, offering features like offline access, push notifications, and
installability. Beyond these, modern PWAs are increasingly granted system-level
capabilities such as auto-start on login and shared context with native
applications. However, their permission management remains poorly defined and
inconsistently implemented across platforms and browsers.
  To investigate these gaps, we developed Permissioner, a cross-platform
analysis tool, and conducted a systematic study of PWA permissions. Our
analysis uncovered critical issues of inconsistency, incompleteness, and
unclear boundaries in permission enforcement, leading to various attacks
including permission leakage, device identification, and Permission API abuse.
We further examined why some browsers resist adopting more granular permission
controls, identifying trade-offs involving usability, compatibility, and
platform limitations. Through collaboration with browser vendors, several
issues reported in our findings were acknowledged and resolved, notably by
Firefox and Chrome. Our work highlights the urgent need for a unified, robust
permission model for PWAs and provides actionable guidance toward achieving
this goal.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modern optical mouse sensors, with their advanced precision and high
responsiveness, possess an often overlooked vulnerability: they can be
exploited for side-channel attacks. This paper introduces Mic-E-Mouse, the
first-ever side-channel attack that targets high-performance optical mouse
sensors to covertly eavesdrop on users. We demonstrate that audio signals can
induce subtle surface vibrations detectable by a mouse's optical sensor.
Remarkably, user-space software on popular operating systems can collect and
broadcast this sensitive side channel, granting attackers access to raw mouse
data without requiring direct system-level permissions. Initially, the
vibration signals extracted from mouse data are of poor quality due to
non-uniform sampling, a non-linear frequency response, and significant
quantization. To overcome these limitations, Mic-E-Mouse employs a
sophisticated end-to-end data filtering pipeline that combines Wiener
filtering, resampling corrections, and an innovative encoder-only spectrogram
neural filtering technique. We evaluate the attack's efficacy across diverse
conditions, including speaking volume, mouse polling rate and DPI, surface
materials, speaker languages, and environmental noise. In controlled
environments, Mic-E-Mouse improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by up to +19
dB for speech reconstruction. Furthermore, our results demonstrate a speech
recognition accuracy of roughly 42% to 61% on the AudioMNIST and VCTK datasets.

### [7] [Agentic JWT: A Secure Delegation Protocol for Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13597)
*Abhishek Goswami*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents Agentic JWT (A-JWT), a secure authorization framework for autonomous LLM agents that binds their actions to verifiable user intent and workflow steps using dual-faceted intent tokens, proof-of-possession keys, and self-verifying client libraries, enabling zero-trust guarantees in agentic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OAuth 2.0 frameworks lack mechanisms to handle agentic systems' stochastic reasoning patterns, prompt injections, and multi-agent orchestration risks, which can silently escalate privileges and undermine API security in autonomous AI operations.

Method: A-JWT employs: (1) One-way checksum hashes for agent identity derived from prompts/tools/configurations, (2) Chained delegation assertions for workflow-specific authority, (3) Per-agent proof-of-possession keys for anti-replay/anti-impersonation, and (4) A lightweight runtime shim that self-verifies code, mints tokens, tracks workflows, and derives cryptographic keys.

Result: The solution achieves: (1) Sub-millisecond overhead with commodity hardware, (2) Effective blocking of scope violations, replay attacks, impersonation, and prompt injections, (3) Alignment with ongoing OAuth agent standard discussions, and (4) A Python proof-of-concept with experimental validation of threat-mitigation capabilities.

Conclusion: A-JWT provides a zero-trust, drop-in solution for securing autonomous agent systems, addressing critical gaps in agent authentication, intent verification, and process-isolated identity management within existing OAuth frameworks, with further journal publication planned.

Abstract: Autonomous LLM agents can issue thousands of API calls per hour without human
oversight. OAuth 2.0 assumes deterministic clients, but in agentic settings
stochastic reasoning, prompt injection, or multi-agent orchestration can
silently expand privileges.
  We introduce Agentic JWT (A-JWT), a dual-faceted intent token that binds each
agent's action to verifiable user intent and, optionally, to a specific
workflow step. A-JWT carries an agent's identity as a one-way checksum hash
derived from its prompt, tools and configuration, and a chained delegation
assertion to prove which downstream agent may execute a given task, and
per-agent proof-of-possession keys to prevent replay and in-process
impersonation. We define a new authorization mechanism and add a lightweight
client shim library that self-verifies code at run time, mints intent tokens,
tracks workflow steps and derives keys, thus enabling secure agent identity and
separation even within a single process.
  We illustrate a comprehensive threat model for agentic applications,
implement a Python proof-of-concept and show functional blocking of
scope-violating requests, replay, impersonation, and prompt-injection pathways
with sub-millisecond overhead on commodity hardware. The design aligns with
ongoing OAuth agent discussions and offers a drop-in path toward zero-trust
guarantees for agentic applications. A comprehensive performance and security
evaluation with experimental results will appear in our forthcoming journal
publication

### [9] [Is Research Software Science a Metascience?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13436)
*Evan Eisinger,Michael A. Heroux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper argues that Research Software Science (RSS) should be classified as metascience to improve scientific reliability by aligning software development with broader reproducibility goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classification of RSS as metascience impacts recognition, funding, and integration into research improvement, as scientific reliability depends on software quality, reproducibility, and transparency.

Method: Defined metascience and RSS, compared their principles and objectives, examined overlaps, and analyzed arguments for/against classification.

Result: RSS advances core metascience goals (especially computational reproducibility), bridges technical/social/cognitive aspects, and its classification depends on broad/narrow definitions of metascience.

Conclusion: RSS is best understood as a distinct interdisciplinary domain that aligns with (and in some definitions fits within) metascience, which can strengthen its role in improving reliability, justify funding, and elevate software development in institutions.

Abstract: As research increasingly relies on computational methods, the reliability of
scientific results depends on the quality, reproducibility, and transparency of
research software. Ensuring these qualities is critical for scientific
integrity and discovery. This paper asks whether Research Software Science
(RSS)--the empirical study of how research software is developed and
used--should be considered a form of metascience, the science of science.
Classification matters because it could affect recognition, funding, and
integration of RSS into research improvement. We define metascience and RSS,
compare their principles and objectives, and examine their overlaps. Arguments
for classification highlight shared commitments to reproducibility,
transparency, and empirical study of research processes. Arguments against
portraying RSS as a specialized domain focused on a tool rather than the
broader scientific enterprise. Our analysis finds RSS advances core goals of
metascience, especially in computational reproducibility, and bridges
technical, social, and cognitive aspects of research. Its classification
depends on whether one adopts a broad definition of metascience--any empirical
effort to improve science--or a narrow one focused on systemic and
epistemological structures. We argue RSS is best understood as a distinct
interdisciplinary domain that aligns with, and in some definitions fits within,
metascience. Recognizing it as such can strengthen its role in improving
reliability, justify funding, and elevate software development in research
institutions. Regardless of classification, applying scientific rigor to
research software ensures the tools of discovery meet the standards of the
discoveries themselves.

### [10] [An LLM Agentic Approach for Legal-Critical Software: A Case Study for Tax Prep Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13471)
*Sina Gogani-Khiabani,Ashutosh Trivedi,Diptikalyan Saha,Saeid Tizpaz-Niari*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an agentic LLM framework for developing reliable legal-critical software by combining metamorphic testing with automated test generation, demonstrated through U.S. tax code translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face reliability challenges in legal domains (e.g., ambiguity, hallucinations) and test-case generation is hindered by the oracle problem requiring legal interpretation.

Method: The authors introduce higher-order metamorphic relations for structured test case comparisons and a multi-agent system with LLM-driven code synthesis and metamorphic-testing agents.

Result: Using GPT-4o-mini, their framework achieves a 45-159 percentage point improvement in worst-case pass rates versus frontier models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, 9-15%) on complex tax-code tasks.

Conclusion: Agentic LLM approaches with structured testing methods enable more robust legal-critical software from natural-language specifications, challenging assumptions about model scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for translating natural-language
statutes into executable logic, but reliability in legally critical settings
remains challenging due to ambiguity and hallucinations. We present an agentic
approach for developing legal-critical software, using U.S. federal tax
preparation as a case study. The key challenge is test-case generation under
the oracle problem, where correct outputs require interpreting law. Building on
metamorphic testing, we introduce higher-order metamorphic relations that
compare system outputs across structured shifts among similar individuals.
Because authoring such relations is tedious and error-prone, we use an
LLM-driven, role-based framework to automate test generation and code
synthesis. We implement a multi-agent system that translates tax code into
executable software and incorporates a metamorphic-testing agent that searches
for counterexamples. In experiments, our framework using a smaller model
(GPT-4o-mini) achieves a worst-case pass rate of 45%, outperforming frontier
models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, 9-15%) on complex tax-code tasks. These results
support agentic LLM methodologies as a path to robust, trustworthy
legal-critical software from natural-language specifications.

### [11] [Prompt2DAG: A Modular Methodology for LLM-Based Data Enrichment Pipeline Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13487)
*Abubakari Alidu,Michele Ciavotta,Flavio DePaoli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Prompt2DAG converts natural language into Apache Airflow DAGs. Hybrid method (78.5% success) best balances reliability and flexibility for automated workflows. Useful for democratizing data pipeline development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating robust data enrichment pipelines needs significant engineering. Converting natural language to executable workflows could reduce this barrier but requires reliable automation strategies.

Method: Compared four approaches (Direct, LLM-only, Hybrid, Template-based) across 260 experiments with 13 LLMs and 5 case studies. Evaluated using a scoring system combining reliability with code quality (SAT), structural integrity (DST), and executability (PCT).

Result: Hybrid approach achieved 78.5% success rate with high quality metrics (SAT: 6.79, DST: 7.67, PCT: 7.76), outperforming LLM-only (66.2%) and Direct (29.2%). Hybrid was 2.34x more cost-effective than Direct method.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach is best for balancing flexibility and reliability in automated workflow generation. This method offers a practical solution to reduce engineering burden and democratize data pipeline development.

Abstract: Developing reliable data enrichment pipelines demands significant engineering
expertise. We present Prompt2DAG, a methodology that transforms natural
language descriptions into executable Apache Airflow DAGs. We evaluate four
generation approaches -- Direct, LLM-only, Hybrid, and Template-based -- across
260 experiments using thirteen LLMs and five case studies to identify optimal
strategies for production-grade automation. Performance is measured using a
penalized scoring framework that combines reliability with code quality (SAT),
structural integrity (DST), and executability (PCT). The Hybrid approach
emerges as the optimal generative method, achieving a 78.5% success rate with
robust quality scores (SAT: 6.79, DST: 7.67, PCT: 7.76). This significantly
outperforms the LLM-only (66.2% success) and Direct (29.2% success) methods.
Our findings show that reliability, not intrinsic code quality, is the primary
differentiator. Cost-effectiveness analysis reveals the Hybrid method is over
twice as efficient as Direct prompting per successful DAG. We conclude that a
structured, hybrid approach is essential for balancing flexibility and
reliability in automated workflow generation, offering a viable path to
democratize data pipeline development.

### [12] [Crash Report Enhancement with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13535)
*S M Farah Al Fahim,Md Nakhla Rafi,Zeyang Ma,Dong Jae Kim,Tse-Hsun,Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how large language models (LLMs) can enhance crash reports by adding diagnostic details, comparing two strategies (Direct-LLM and Agentic-LLM) and demonstrating significant improvements in problem localization and repair guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crash reports often lack sufficient diagnostic detail for efficient debugging. The authors aim to explore whether LLMs can automatically enrich crash reports with fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions to aid developers.

Method: The study compares two approaches: Direct-LLM (single-shot stack-trace analysis) and Agentic-LLM (iterative repository exploration). Evaluations include quantitative metrics (localization accuracy, CodeBLEU), manual assessments, and a user study with 16 participants.

Result: LLM-enhanced reports achieved 40.2-43.1─ Top-1 localization accuracy (vs. 10.6─ original), with CodeBLEU scores of 56-57─ for fixes. Agentic-LLM outperformed Direct-LLM in root-cause explanations and repair guidance, confirmed by both automated and user studies.

Conclusion: Supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code significantly enhances crash report utility for debugging. Agentic-LLM offers stronger performance, particularly in actionable repair guidance, making crashes easier to resolve.

Abstract: Crash reports are central to software maintenance, yet many lack the
diagnostic detail developers need to debug efficiently. We examine whether
large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations,
root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement
strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context,
and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for
additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced
reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original
reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble
developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and
LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause
explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16
participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to
understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These
results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code
yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.

### [13] [GitHub's Copilot Code Review: Can AI Spot Security Flaws Before You Commit?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13650)
*Amena Amro,Manar H. Alalfi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Study assesses GitHub Copilot's security code review capabilities, finding it misses critical vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS) while focusing on low-severity issues, highlighting the need for dedicated security tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI tools become widespread in coding, establishing their ability to support secure development practices is critical for preventing vulnerabilities in modern software systems.

Method: Systematic evaluation of Copilot's code review feature using curated vulnerable code samples from open-source projects across multiple languages and domains.

Result: Copilot frequently fails to detect high-severity security flaws like SQL injection and XSS, instead prioritizing low-severity issues such as style errors and typos.

Conclusion: Current AI-assisted code review capabilities show significant limitations in security detection, emphasizing the continued necessity for specialized security tools and manual code audits.

Abstract: As software development practices increasingly adopt AI-powered tools,
ensuring that such tools can support secure coding has become critical. This
study evaluates the effectiveness of GitHub Copilot's recently introduced code
review feature in detecting security vulnerabilities. Using a curated set of
labeled vulnerable code samples drawn from diverse open-source projects
spanning multiple programming languages and application domains, we
systematically assessed Copilot's ability to identify and provide feedback on
common security flaws. Contrary to expectations, our results reveal that
Copilot's code review frequently fails to detect critical vulnerabilities such
as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure deserialization.
Instead, its feedback primarily addresses low-severity issues, such as coding
style and typographical errors. These findings expose a significant gap between
the perceived capabilities of AI-assisted code review and its actual
effectiveness in supporting secure development practices. Our results highlight
the continued necessity of dedicated security tools and manual code audits to
ensure robust software security.
