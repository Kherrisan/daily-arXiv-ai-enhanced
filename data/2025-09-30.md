TL;DR: This paper presents a large benchmark for vericoding, the generation of formally verified code from specifications, and tests it with LLMs.

Motivation: The motivation arises from the need for more reliable code generation by moving from vibe coding (with potential bugs) to vericoding with formal verification.

Method: The authors compiled a benchmark of 12,504 formal specifications across three languages (Dafny, Verus/Rust, Lean) and used off-the-shelf LLMs to generate verified code from them.

Result: LLMs achieved 82% success in Dafny, 44% in Verus/Rust, and 27% in Lean. Adding natural-language descriptions doesn't notably enhance performance. Dafny verification improved from 68% to 96% over a year.

Conclusion: A large and diverse vericoding benchmark was created and tested; LLMs show best performance on Dafny. There is room for improvement as lower rates persist in other languages.

Abstract: We present and test the largest benchmark for vericoding, LLM-generation of
formally verified code from formal specifications - in contrast to vibe coding,
which generates potentially buggy code from a natural language description. Our
benchmark contains 12,504 formal specifications, with 3,029 in Dafny, 2,334 in
Verus/Rust and 7,141 in Lean. Of these, 6,174 are new unseen problems. We find
vericoding success rates of 27% in Lean, 44% in Verus/Rust and 82% in Dafny
using off-the-shelf LLMs. Adding natural-language descriptions does not
significantly improve performance. We also find that LLM progress has improved
progress on pure Dafny verification from 68% to 96% over the past year. The
benchmark and vericoding results are shared at
