According to the widely\nadopted testing pyramid, unit tests constitute the majority of test cases and\nare often schematic, requiring minimal domain expertise. Automatically\ngenerating such tests under the supervision of software engineers can\nsignificantly enhance productivity during the development phase of the software\nlifecycle.\n  This paper investigates the impact of code context and prompting strategies\non the quality and adequacy of unit tests generated by various large language\nmodels (LLMs) across several families. The results show that including\ndocstrings notably improves code adequacy, while further extending context to\nthe full implementation yields definitely smaller gains. Notably, the\nchain-of-thought prompting strategy -- applied even to 'reasoning' models --\nachieves the best results, with up to 96.3\\% branch coverage, a 57\\% average\nmutation score, and near-perfect compilation success rate.

It\ninvolves breaking down the input into units that are later passed to the\nlanguage model stack to learn high-dimensional representations used in various\ncontexts, from classification to generation. However, the output of these\ntokenizers is often longer than that traditionally used in compilers and\ninterpreters. This could result in undesirable effects, such as increased\ncomputational overhead. In this work, we investigate the effect of merging the\nhidden representations of subtokens that belong to the same semantic unit, such\nas subtokens that form a single identifier. We propose two strategies: one\nbased on averaging the representations and another that leverages a\nlearning-based approach. Both methods can be seamlessly integrated with\nexisting language models for code. We conduct experiments using six language\nmodels for code: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXCoder, CdoeT5, CodeT5+ (220M),\nand CodeT5+ (770M), across three software engineering tasks: vulnerability\ndetection, code classification, and code translation.

While CGTs offer potential\nproductivity enhancements, their effectiveness across diverse user groups have\nnot been sufficiently investigated. Objectives: We hypothesize that developers'\ninteractions with CGTs vary based on gender, influencing task outcomes and\ncognitive load, as prior research suggests that gender differences can affect\ntechnology use and cognitive processing. Methods: The study will employ a\nmixed-subjects design with 54 participants, evenly divided by gender for a\ncounterbalanced design. Participants will complete two programming tasks\n(medium to hard difficulty) with only CGT assistance and then with only\ninternet access. Task orders and conditions will be counterbalanced to mitigate\norder effects. Data collection will include cognitive load surveys, screen\nrecordings, and task performance metrics such as completion time, code\ncorrectness, and CGT interaction behaviors. Statistical analyses will be\nconducted to identify statistically significant differences in CGT usage.\nExpected Contributions: Our work can uncover gender differences in CGT\ninteraction and performance among developers. Our findings can inform future\nCGT designs and help address usability and potential disparities in interaction\npatterns across diverse user groups.

They enable secure data processing and sharing in\npeer-to-peer networks, such as vehicular ad hoc networks of autonomous\nvehicles, without compromising confidentiality. In these networks, nodes must\nestablish mutual trust to collaborate securely. TEEs can achieve this through\nremote attestation, where a prover presents evidence of its trustworthiness to\na verifier, which then decides whether or not to trust the prover. However, a\nnaive peer-to-peer attestation approach, where every TEE directly attests every\nother TEE, results in quadratic communication overhead. This is inefficient in\ndynamic environments, where nodes frequently join and leave the network.\n  To address this, we present Careful Whisper, a gossip-based protocol that\ndisseminates trust efficiently, reducing attestation overhead to linear\ncomplexity under ideal conditions. It enables interoperability by enabling\ntransitive trust across heterogeneous networks, and supports trust\nestablishment with offline nodes via relayed attestations. Using a custom\ndiscrete-event simulator, we show that Careful Whisper propagates trust both\nfaster and more widely than naive approaches across various network topologies.\nOur results demonstrate that our protocol is resource efficient, sending ~21.5\nKiB and requiring 0.158 seconds per round in a 200-node network, and that our\nprotocol is resilient to attestation failures across various network\ntopologies."}

In\nparticular, we propose AlphaCC, which represents code fragments as token\nsequences to ensure multi-language applicability and adapts AlphaFold's\nsequence-to-structure modeling capability to infer code semantics. The pipeline\nof AlphaCC goes through three steps. First, AlphaCC transforms each input code\nfragment into a token sequence and, motivated by AlphaFold's use of multiple\nsequence alignment (MSA) to enhance contextual understanding, constructs an MSA\nfrom lexically similar token sequences. Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified\nattention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and\nacross token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure\nprediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences\nthrough a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to\ndetermine code clone pairs.

We thus obtain a reasonable signature size, which brings\ndiversity in the landscape of post-quantum signature schemes, by relying on a\nnew hard problem. In particular, this new signature scheme performs better than\nSPHINCS+, with a smaller size of public key + signature. Our signature compares\nalso well with other signature schemes: compared to MEDS, the signature is\nsmaller, and we reduced the size of the sum of signature and public key by a\nfactor close to 5. We also obtain a signature size that is almost half the size\nof the CROSS signature scheme."}

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source\ntext-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12\nbillion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises\nconcerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability.\n  Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the\nenvironment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to\nenhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models.\n  Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters\nand prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated\nimages while also lowering the energy consumption required for image\ngeneration. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to\nthat of the original SD model.\n  Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion,\ntesting it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our\nresults demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%,\nethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and\nGPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are\nconsistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts.\n  Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social\nand environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible\nwithout fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture."}

To defend against such threats, we propose\nPiMRef, the first reference-based phishing email detector that leverages\nknowledge-based invariants. Our core insight is that persuasive phishing emails\noften contain disprovable identity claims, which contradict real-world facts.\nPiMRef reframes phishing detection as an identity fact-checking task. Given an\nemail, PiMRef (i) extracts the sender's claimed identity, (ii) verifies the\nlegitimacy of the sender's domain against a predefined knowledge base, and\n(iii) detects call-to-action prompts that push user engagement.

We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses\nmild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM\nintegrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for\nthese multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory,\noptimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks\nare shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context\n(e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety\nmeasures are in place.\n  We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including\nstatistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization\ntechniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is\nsupported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we\nderive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training\nand demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with\nhigh AUC.
