Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering\nlimited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving,\nAI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam\nconversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial\nintelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with\nharm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model\nupdates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system\nproduces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement\n$\\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism,\nsafety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models\ntrained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement\n($\\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage\n($\\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain\nstable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing\nperformance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3,\nMD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce\nthe chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the\nmodel engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer\nand richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of\nhigher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify\nreal-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety\nmoderation into a proactive defense paradigm."}

To harness these new capabilities while ensuring\ntrustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in\nthe Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE\nfor Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational\npillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest\ndifferently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to\nsupport this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command\ncenter where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such\nas Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The\nAgent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform\ntasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex\ntrade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated\nhuman callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering\nactivities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating\nthe practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering.

That is, we remove instances from the benchmarks while\ntrying to keep the same rankings of the variants on all tests. Our method,\nBISection Sampling, BISS, strategically retains the most critical tests and\napplies a novel divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently sample among\nrelevant remaining tests. We experiment with datasets and use cases from LLM\nleaderboards, SAT competitions, and configurable systems for performance\nmodeling. Our results show that our method outperforms baselines even when\noperating on a subset of variants. Using BISS, we reduce the computational cost\nof the benchmarks on average to 44% and on more than half the benchmarks by up\nto 99% without loss in ranking stability."}

Due to the high cost of\nlabeling and maintenance, recent research has turned to online HD map\nconstruction using onboard sensor data, offering wider coverage and more timely\nupdates for autonomous vehicles. However, the robustness of online map\nconstruction under adversarial conditions remains underexplored. In this paper,\nwe present a systematic vulnerability analysis of online map construction\nmodels, which reveals that these models exhibit an inherent bias toward\npredicting symmetric road structures. In asymmetric scenes like forks or\nmerges, this bias often causes the model to mistakenly predict a straight\nboundary that mirrors the opposite side. We demonstrate that this vulnerability\npersists in the real-world and can be reliably triggered by obstruction or\ntargeted interference. Leveraging this vulnerability, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage attack framework capable of manipulating online constructed maps.\nFirst, our method identifies vulnerable asymmetric scenes along the victim AV's\npotential route. Then, we optimize the location and pattern of camera-blinding\nattacks and adversarial patch attacks.

In this paper, we reveal a new class of\nattacks, Parasitic Toolchain Attacks, instantiated as MCP Unintended Privacy\nDisclosure (MCP-UPD). These attacks require no direct victim interaction;\ninstead, adversaries embed malicious instructions into external data sources\nthat LLMs access during legitimate tasks. The malicious logic infiltrates the\ntoolchain and unfolds in three phases: Parasitic Ingestion, Privacy Collection,\nand Privacy Disclosure, culminating in stealthy exfiltration of private data.\nOur root cause analysis reveals that MCP lacks both context-tool isolation and\nleast-privilege enforcement, enabling adversarial instructions to propagate\nunchecked into sensitive tool invocations. To assess the severity, we design\nMCP-SEC and conduct the first large-scale security census of the MCP ecosystem,\nanalyzing 12,230 tools across 1,360 servers.

Layer 2 Rollups (L2s) are a faster alternative to\nconventional blockchains. L2s perform most computations offchain using\nminimally blockchains (L1) under-the-hood to guarantee correctness. A sequencer\nis a service that receives offchain L2 transaction requests, batches these\ntransactions, and commits compressed or hashed batches to L1. Using hashing\nneeds less L1 space, which is beneficial for gas cost, but requires a data\navailability committee (DAC) service to translate hashes into their\ncorresponding batches of transaction requests. The behavior of sequencers and\nDACs influence the evolution of the L2 blockchain, presenting a potential\nsecurity threat and delaying L2 adoption. We propose in this paper fraud-proof\nmechanisms, arbitrated by L1 contracts, to detect and generate evidence of\ndishonest behavior of the sequencer and DAC. We study how these fraud-proofs\nlimit the power of adversaries that control different number of sequencer and\nDACs members, and provide incentives for their honest behavior. We designed\nthese fraud-proof mechanisms as two player games. Unlike the generic\nfraud-proofs in current L2s (designed to guarantee the correct execution of\ntransactions), our fraud-proofs are over pred-etermined algorithms that verify\nthe properties that determine the correctness of the DAC. Arbitrating over\nconcrete algorithms makes our fraud-proofs more efficient, easier to\nunderstand, and simpler to prove correct. We provide as an artifact a\nmechanization in LEAN4 of our fraud-proof games, including (1) the verified\nstrategies that honest players should play to win all games as well as (2)\nmechanisms to detect dishonest claims."}

Although this attack\nvector has been investigated for many other Web3 protocols, such as Bitcoin and\nEthereum, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been analyzed for the IPFS\nnetwork. In our work, we bridge this gap and demonstrate that BGP routing\nattacks can be effectively leveraged to censor content in IPFS. For the\nanalysis, we collected 3,000 content blocks called CIDs and conducted a\nsimulation of BGP hijacking and passive interception against them. We find that\na single malicious AS can censor 75% of the IPFS content for more than 57% of\nall requester nodes. Furthermore, we show that even with a small set of only 62\nhijacked prefixes, 70% of the full attack effectiveness can already be reached.\nWe further propose and validate countermeasures based on global collaborative\ncontent replication among all nodes in the IPFS network, together with\nadditional robust backup content provider nodes that are well-hardened against\nBGP hijacking.
