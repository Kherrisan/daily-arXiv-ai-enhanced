However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on\ntechnical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream\n\"silent fixes\", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a\ndangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable\nthe necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,\nwe conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a\nholistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical\nframework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External\nThreat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a\ncritical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an\nundefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the\nimpact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical\nchain: \"Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation\" (OTVM). This\nprovides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.\nBased on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a \"Strategic Objectives Matrix\"\nto clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,\nEx-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and\n(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these\nvulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three\nindustry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.\nThis work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for\nenterprises to shift from reactive \"firefighting\" to proactively building an\norganizational \"immune system\".", "AI": {"tldr": "The study presents a holistic risk governance framework for enterprises using open source, addressing both technical and non-technical threats.", "motivation": "Traditional risk management is inadequate for the complex, systemic threats faced by enterprises integrating open source strategically.", "method": "The authors conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a risk governance framework based on the principle of External Threats exploiting Internal Vulnerabilities.", "result": "The framework includes a Strategic Objectives Matrix, a dual taxonomy of threats and vulnerabilities, and a mitigation strategy, validated by industry experts through case studies.", "conclusion": "The framework enables enterprises to shift from reactive firefighting to proactive risk governance, enhancing their organizational resilience."}}
