### [1] [Safeguarding Federated Learning-based Road Condition Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12568)
*Sheng Liu,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper highlights the vulnerability of Federated Learning (FL) based Road Condition Classification (RCC) systems to Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs) and proposes FLARE, a neuron-wise analysis defense mechanism, to mitigate these threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL-RCC systems are exposed to TLFAs where malicious clients manipulate training labels to degrade road condition safety inference, risking autonomous vehicles misjudging dangerous conditions due to privacy-preserving data non-sharing.

Method: The authors (1) analyzed existing FL-RCC vulnerabilities to TLFAs, (2) developed a label-distance-based metric to quantify safety risks, and (3) designed FLARE using output layer neuron-wise analysis for attack mitigation.

Result: Experiments over three RCC tasks, four metrics, six baselines, and three models demonstrated the effectiveness of FLARE in reducing TLFAs impact while confirming the severity of these attacks on FL-RCC systems.

Conclusion: TLFAs present critical safety risks for FL-based RCC systems in autonomous driving, and FLARE provides a robust defense solution to address these vulnerabilities through neuron-wise analysis.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for
privacy-preserving autonomous driving, specifically camera-based Road Condition
Classification (RCC) systems, harnessing distributed sensing, computing, and
communication resources on board vehicles without sharing sensitive image data.
However, the collaborative nature of FL-RCC frameworks introduces new
vulnerabilities: Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), in which malicious
clients (vehicles) deliberately alter their training data labels to compromise
the learned model inference performance. Such attacks can, e.g., cause a
vehicle to mis-classify slippery, dangerous road conditions as pristine and
exceed recommended speed. However, TLFAs for FL-based RCC systems are largely
missing. We address this challenge with a threefold contribution: 1) we
disclose the vulnerability of existing FL-RCC systems to TLFAs; 2) we introduce
a novel label-distance-based metric to precisely quantify the safety risks
posed by TLFAs; and 3) we propose FLARE, a defensive mechanism leveraging
neuron-wise analysis of the output layer to mitigate TLFA effects. Extensive
experiments across three RCC tasks, four evaluation metrics, six baselines, and
three deep learning models demonstrate both the severity of TLFAs on FL-RCC
systems and the effectiveness of FLARE in mitigating the attack impact.

### [2] [On the Consideration of Vanity Address Generation via Identity-Based Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12670)
*Shogo Murasaki,Kazumasa Omote,Keita Emura*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores using identity-based signatures (IBS) with Ethereum's ECDSA key recovery to generate vanity blockchain addresses efficiently while maintaining compatibility and low gas costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanity addresses are limited by inefficient try-and-error generation methods, and replacing ECDSA with traditional IBS in Ethereum is impractical due to cost and compatibility constraints.

Method: The authors investigate a generic IBS construction from signatures and adapt ECDSA key recovery functionality to enable custom string association with addresses in Solidity.

Result: They implement an IBS-based system compatible with Ethereum, demonstrating gas costs comparable to standard ECDSA signature verification for vanity address generation.

Conclusion: IBS can enhance address customization without requiring full ECDSA replacement, offering a practical balance between vanity address flexibility and Ethereum's existing cost structure.

Abstract: An address is indicated as an identifier of the user on the blockchain, and
is defined by a hash value of the ECDSA verification key. A vanity address is
an address that embeds custom characters such as a name. To generate a vanity
address, a classical try-and-error method is employed, and thus the number of
characters to be embedded is limited. In this paper, we focus on the
functionality of identity-based signatures (IBS) where any strings can be
employed as a verification key, and explore whether IBS can be used for
generating a vanity address. We attach importance to the fact that it is not
realistic to replace ECDSA with key recovery, which is currently employed for
issuing transactions in Ethereum, to an IBS scheme. Even if this replacement is
possible, it is not a reasonable price for the ease of the vanity address
generation. Thus, we pay attention to a generic construction of IBS from
signatures, and construct an IBS scheme from ECDSA with key recovery. Though we
cannot directly generate a vanity address due to the key recovery functionality
of the underlying ECDSA, we can connect any string with an address due to the
functionality of IBS that can give additional meaning to the address. We
implement our system by Solidity, and demonstrate that the gas cost is almost
same as that of the ECDSA signature verification.

### [3] [Architectural Backdoors in Deep Learning: A Survey of Vulnerabilities, Detection, and Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12919)
*Victoria Childress,Josh Collyer,Jodie Knapp*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This survey analyzes architectural backdoors in deep learning systems, highlighting their unique threat beyond traditional attacks and current limitations in detection/defense while proposing future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural backdoors represent a critical, under-examined threat to neural networks that persist after retraining and evade conventional mitigation techniques, requiring urgent attention.

Method: Systematic literature review spanning compiler manipulations, AutoML pipeline attacks, supply-chain vulnerabilities; evaluation of emergence detection strategies (static/dynamic analysis, formal verification) and their limitations against stealthy triggers.

Result: Surveys reveal detection methods struggle with distributed/stealth triggers, and practical scalable defenses remain unstudied despite some progress in the field.

Conclusion: Highlights open challenges in supply-chain security, proposes improving cryptographic attestation methods, and suggests developing next-gen benchmarks to enable comprehensive defense strategies against structural backdoors.

Abstract: Architectural backdoors pose an under-examined but critical threat to deep
neural networks, embedding malicious logic directly into a model's
computational graph. Unlike traditional data poisoning or parameter
manipulation, architectural backdoors evade standard mitigation techniques and
persist even after clean retraining. This survey systematically consolidates
research on architectural backdoors, spanning compiler-level manipulations,
tainted AutoML pipelines, and supply-chain vulnerabilities. We assess emerging
detection and defense strategies, including static graph inspection, dynamic
fuzzing, and partial formal verification, and highlight their limitations
against distributed or stealth triggers. Despite recent progress, scalable and
practical defenses remain elusive. We conclude by outlining open challenges and
proposing directions for strengthening supply-chain security, cryptographic
model attestations, and next-generation benchmarks. This survey aims to guide
future research toward comprehensive defenses against structural backdoor
threats in deep learning systems.

### [4] [Enterprise Security Incident Analysis and Countermeasures Based on the T-Mobile Data Breach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12937)
*Zhuohan Cui,Zikun Song*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes T-Mobile's data breaches (2021-2023) via case-based vulnerability assessments and ethical hacking techniques, then proposes a cost-effective multi-layered defensive strategy validated by financial modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-breach vulnerabilities in telecom systems remain a critical risk, necessitating proactive measures to prevent losses and ensure compliance with regulations.

Method: Combined forensic analysis of breaches with active security testing (Shodan reconnaissance, API misuse simulations, VNC brute-forcing, firmware reverse engineering, and web application scans) to identify structural weaknesses.

Result: Exposed persistent vulnerabilities beyond breaches, implemented defenses (Zero Trust, RBAC, network segmentation, AES firmware encryption, API rate limiting), and proved defense costs (1.1% of 5-year breach losses) for telecom resilience.

Conclusion: Proactive multi-layered security strategies are validated as cost-effective for telecoms, offering actionable resilience against evolving threats while achieving regulatory compliance.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of T-Mobile's critical data
breaches in 2021 and 2023, alongside a full-spectrum security audit targeting
its systems, infrastructure, and publicly exposed endpoints. By combining
case-based vulnerability assessments with active ethical hacking
techniques--including Shodan reconnaissance, API misuse simulations, VNC
brute-forcing, firmware reverse engineering, and web application scans--we
uncover structural weaknesses persisting beyond the initial breach events.
Building on these findings, we propose a multi-layered defensive strategy
encompassing Zero Trust Architecture, granular role-based access control,
network segmentation, firmware encryption using AES with integrity checks, and
API rate limiting and token lifecycle control. Financial modelling demonstrates
that a five-year investment yields less than 1.1% of expected breach losses,
validating the cost-effectiveness of proactive security measures. Our work
bridges post-incident forensic analysis with hands-on security evaluation,
providing an actionable blueprint for large-scale telecoms seeking operational
resilience, regulatory compliance, and cross-domain threat readiness.

### [5] [Measuring CEX-DEX Extracted Value and Searcher Profitability: The Darkest of the MEV Dark Forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13023)
*Fei Wu,Danning Sui,Thomas Thiery,Mallesh Pai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper empirically analyzes CEX-DEX arbitrage dynamics on Ethereum, revealing centralization trends, searcher-builder profitability linkages, and underestimated builder profits, with implications for decentralization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To illuminate the economic mechanisms and decentralization implications of cross-exchange arbitrage in Ethereum's MEV ecosystem by creating a framework to estimate arbitrage revenue from on-chain data alone.

Method: Combined refined on-chain arbitrage identification heuristics with a novel empirical framework analyzing 19 months (Aug 2023-Mar 2025) of transaction data to estimate searcher revenue and market impact.

Result: Identified 7.2M CEX-DEX arbitrages totaling $233.8M in profits, showed top 3 searchers captured 75% of volume/value, demonstrated searcher profitability depends on block builder integration, and corrected builder profit estimates for vertical integration.

Conclusion: Uncovers systemic centralization risks in Ethereum's MEV landscape through CEX-DEX arbitrage activities, challenges previous profitability assessments of block builders, and highlights potential regulatory and protocol design implications for decentralized exchange markets.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of the economics and
dynamics behind arbitrages between centralized and decentralized exchanges
(CEX-DEX) on Ethereum. We refine heuristics to identify arbitrage transactions
from on-chain data and introduce a robust empirical framework to estimate
arbitrage revenue without knowing traders' actual behaviors on CEX. Leveraging
an extensive dataset spanning 19 months from August 2023 to March 2025, we
estimate a total of 233.8M USD extracted by 19 major CEX-DEX searchers from
7,203,560 identified CEX-DEX arbitrages. Our analysis reveals increasing
centralization trends as three searchers captured three-quarters of both volume
and extracted value. We also demonstrate that searchers' profitability is tied
to their integration level with block builders and uncover exclusive
searcher-builder relationships and their market impact. Finally, we correct the
previously underestimated profitability of block builders who vertically
integrate with a searcher. These insights illuminate the darkest corner of the
MEV landscape and highlight the critical implications of CEX-DEX arbitrages for
Ethereum's decentralization.

### [6] [From Paranoia to Compliance: The Bumpy Road of System Hardening Practices on Stack Exchange](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13028)
*Niklas Busch,Philip Klostermeyer,Jan H. Klemmer,Yasemin Acar,Sascha Fahl*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A study analyzing system hardening practices and challenges faced by operators through Stack Exchange posts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Past cyberattacks reveal ineffective system hardening practices by operators, creating a need for understanding motivations, challenges, and misconceptions in this domain.

Method: Qualitative analysis of 316 Stack Exchange posts related to system hardening.

Result: Access control and deployment issues are most challenging; operators frequently focus on OS/server hardening, act out of fear or compliance, and hold misconceptions about hardening effectiveness.

Conclusion: Researchers should consider operator motivations and challenges when designing hardening tools, while organizations need to address the identified misconceptions and realistic expectations for security practices.

Abstract: Hardening computer systems against cyberattacks is crucial for security.
However, past incidents illustrated, that many system operators struggle with
effective system hardening. Hence, many computer systems and applications
remain insecure. So far, the research community lacks an in-depth understanding
of system operators motivation, practices, and challenges around system
hardening. With a focus on practices and challenges, we qualitatively analyzed
316 Stack Exchange (SE) posts related to system hardening. We find that access
control and deployment-related issues are the most challenging, and system
operators suffer from misconceptions and unrealistic expectations. Most
frequently, posts focused on operating systems and server applications. System
operators were driven by the fear of their systems getting attacked or by
compliance reasons. Finally, we discuss our research questions, make
recommendations for future system hardening, and illustrate the implications of
our work.

### [7] [MAD-Spear: A Conformity-Driven Prompt Injection Attack on Multi-Agent Debate Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13038)
*Yu Cui,Hongyang Du*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAD-Spear, a targeted prompt injection attack on multi-agent debate (MAD) systems that exploits LLM conformity tendencies to propagate misinformation. The study proposes a fault-tolerance definition and evaluation framework, demonstrating MAD-Spear's superior effectiveness in degrading system performance. It also challenges prior assumptions by showing agent diversity significantly improves mathematical reasoning in MAD systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on multi-agent debate systems focuses on improving accuracy and scalability but overlooks critical security risks, necessitating systematic investigation of vulnerabilities like prompt injection attacks.

Method: 1) MAD-Spear attack design: Compromises a small subset of agents to produce plausible yet incorrect responses, leveraging LLM conformity. 2) Attack composition with communication strategies to amplify misinformation exposure. 3) Formal definition of MAD fault-tolerance and evaluation framework combining accuracy, consensus efficiency, and scalability. 4) Experiments on five benchmark datasets with varying difficulty levels.

Result: MAD-Spear consistently outperformed baseline attacks in degrading system performance. Agent diversity was found to substantially improve mathematical reasoning performance in MAD systems (contrary to prior claims that diversity had minimal impact).

Conclusion: Security vulnerabilities in MAD systems like prompt injection attacks pose significant risks despite demonstrated benefits of agent diversity for mathematical reasoning. The work underscores the urgent need to incorporate security by design principles for robust MAD implementations.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) systems leverage collaborative interactions among
large language models (LLMs) agents to improve reasoning capabilities. While
recent studies have focused on increasing the accuracy and scalability of MAD
systems, their security vulnerabilities have received limited attention. In
this work, we introduce MAD-Spear, a targeted prompt injection attack that
compromises a small subset of agents but significantly disrupts the overall MAD
process. Manipulated agents produce multiple plausible yet incorrect responses,
exploiting LLMs' conformity tendencies to propagate misinformation and degrade
consensus quality. Furthermore, the attack can be composed with other
strategies, such as communication attacks, to further amplify its impact by
increasing the exposure of agents to incorrect responses. To assess MAD's
resilience under attack, we propose a formal definition of MAD fault-tolerance
and develop a comprehensive evaluation framework that jointly considers
accuracy, consensus efficiency, and scalability. Extensive experiments on five
benchmark datasets with varying difficulty levels demonstrate that MAD-Spear
consistently outperforms the baseline attack in degrading system performance.
Additionally, we observe that agent diversity substantially improves MAD
performance in mathematical reasoning tasks, which challenges prior work
suggesting that agent diversity has minimal impact on performance. These
findings highlight the urgent need to improve the security in MAD design.

### [9] [Prompt Injection 2.0: Hybrid AI Threats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13169)
*Jeremy McHugh,Kristina Šekrst,Jon Cefalu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes advanced prompt injection attacks (Prompt Injection 2.0) that integrate with web vulnerabilities like XSS/CSRF, demonstrating how traditional security measures fail and proposing architectural solutions combining AI-specific defenses. The study evaluates hybrid cyber-AI threats and updates Preamble's research for modern agentic AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of agentic AI systems and hybrid threats combining prompt injection with traditional web exploits necessitates updated security approaches as legacy safeguards (e.g., WAFs, XSS filters) are shown to be insufficient against AI-enhanced attacks.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of prompt injection integration with XSS, CSRF, and other web vulnerabilities. Evaluation of existing mitigation technologies via benchmarks against contemporary threats (AI worms, multi-agent infections). Development of architectural solutions with prompt isolation, runtime security, and privilege separation enhanced by novel threat detection mechanisms.

Result: Demonstrated failures of traditional security measures against hybrid attacks through new benchmarks. Validated architectural solutions that effectively address prompt injection 2.0 and multi-agent threats with enhanced detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Prompt Injection 2.0 requires rethinking security for agentic AI systems by combining traditional controls with AI-specific defenses (prompt isolation, runtime monitoring). Legacy web security architectures are inadequate for emerging multi-step, coordination-based hybrid cyber-AI threats.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks, where malicious input is designed to manipulate AI
systems into ignoring their original instructions and following unauthorized
commands instead, were first discovered by Preamble, Inc. in May 2022 and
responsibly disclosed to OpenAI. Over the last three years, these attacks have
continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The
emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep
tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally
transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now
combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that
systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections
integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),
and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures.
We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies,
evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent
infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent
benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS
filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present
architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and
privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper presents a dataset and experimental comparison of decentralized federated learning (DFL) for IoT malware detection, demonstrating DFL's effectiveness in preserving data locality while maintaining competitive performance against traditional machine learning and centralized federated learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the growing need for privacy-preserving malware detection solutions in IoT crowdsensing environments, where data distribution across devices poses security and privacy challenges.

Method: The authors collected 21.58 million behavioral records (system calls, file activities, etc.) from benign and malicious IoT workloads, aggregated them into 30-second windows to create 342k features, and conducted experiments comparing traditional ML, centralized federated learning (CFL), and DFL under varying node counts, topologies, and data distributions.

Result: DFL maintained comparable performance to non-decentralized methods while outperforming CFL in most scenarios, successfully preserving data locality (no global server), and establishing a benchmark dataset for this domain.

Conclusion: The dataset and results provide a foundational resource for studying DFL in IoT security, showing it as a viable alternative to CFL for distributed malware detection with privacy advantages.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dataset and experimental study for decentralized
federated learning (DFL) applied to IoT crowdsensing malware detection. The
dataset comprises behavioral records from benign and eight malware families. A
total of 21,582,484 original records were collected from system calls, file
system activities, resource usage, kernel events, input/output events, and
network records. These records were aggregated into 30-second windows,
resulting in 342,106 features used for model training and evaluation.
Experiments on the DFL platform compare traditional machine learning (ML),
centralized federated learning (CFL), and DFL across different node counts,
topologies, and data distributions. Results show that DFL maintains competitive
performance while preserving data locality, outperforming CFL in most settings.
This dataset provides a solid foundation for studying the security of IoT
crowdsensing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite growing use of large language models (LLMs) in AIOps, understanding their potential, limitations, and tailored applications remains underdeveloped.

Method: The authors performed a systematic survey of 183 published research papers between 2020 and 2024, addressing four research questions through analysis of data sources, task evolution, LLM application methods, and evaluation frameworks.

Result: The study provides insights into 1) LLM processing of legacy/new failure data sources, 2) emerging AIOps tasks and publication trends, 3) LLM-based methodologies addressing AIOps challenges, and 4) evaluation approaches for LLM-integrated systems.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a foundation for understanding LLMs' role in AIOps, highlights current advancements, identifies underexplored areas, and proposes promising trajectories for future research in the field.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow increasingly sophisticated and
pervasive, their application to various Artificial Intelligence for IT
Operations (AIOps) tasks has garnered significant attention. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the impact, potential, and limitations of LLMs
in AIOps remains in its infancy. To address this gap, we conducted a detailed
survey of LLM4AIOps, focusing on how LLMs can optimize processes and improve
outcomes in this domain. We analyzed 183 research papers published between
January 2020 and December 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In
RQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced
LLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new
data sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks,
highlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across
these tasks. RQ3 investigates the various LLM-based methods applied to address
AIOps challenges. Finally, RQ4 reviews evaluation methodologies tailored to
assess LLM-integrated AIOps approaches. Based on our findings, we discuss the
state-of-the-art advancements and trends, identify gaps in existing research,
and propose promising directions for future exploration.

### [12] [LLM-Powered Quantum Code Transpilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12480)
*Nazanin Siavash,Armin Moin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated, language-agnostic transpilers for quantum SDKs (QSDKs), enabling functional code conversion across quantum computing platforms without requiring manual rule creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum development kits (QSDKs) exhibit significant diversity, making cross-platform quantum-classical software interoperability difficult. Traditional rule-based transpilers for QSDKs require expert knowledge, rigid mappings, and extensive maintenance.

Method: Leverages LLMs' pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities to perform code translations between QSDKs, using their natural language processing abilities to learn patterns from code samples and facilitate functional equivalence preservation during transpilation.

Result: Demonstrated that LLMs can eliminate the need for manual transformation rules while maintaining program functionality when converting between different quantum programming frameworks, offering a scalable solution for QSDK interoperability.

Conclusion: LLMs provide a promising foundation for intelligent, general-purpose quantum program translation, addressing critical portability challenges in hybrid quantum-classical software development ecosystems.

Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different
quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples
include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this
diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and
cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems.
Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are
time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid
mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution.
Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we
position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of
converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving
functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined
transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software
portability. This work represents a step toward enabling intelligent,
general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem.

### [13] [Kodezi Chronos: A Debugging-First Language Model for Repository-Scale, Memory-Driven Code Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12482)
*Ishraq Khan,Assad Chowdary,Sharoz Haseeb,Urvish Patel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Kodezi Chronos is a next-gen architecture for autonomous code tasks that operates across ultra-long contexts, using a multi-level embedding memory engine to handle entire codebases and reduce debugging cycles by 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs face challenges with limited inference-time context and lack of explicit code structure reasoning, restricting their effectiveness in comprehensive code understanding and maintenance tasks.

Method: Chronos employs a multi-level embedding memory engine integrating vector/graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval, enabling efficient reasoning over millions of code lines and supporting repository-scale operations.

Result: Chronos outperforms prior models with 23% better real-world bug detection and a 40% reduction in debugging cycles, validated by a novel Multi Random Retrieval benchmark for software engineering tasks like variable tracing and semantic bug localization.

Conclusion: The introduction of Chronos represents a significant step toward self-sustaining software ecosystems, offering autonomous maintenance through native IDE and CI/CD integration to enhance reliability and productivity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software
automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context
and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a
next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and
maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire
codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits.
Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining
vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This
enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code,
supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and
real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random
Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain.
Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to
resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts,
simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and
semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models,
demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing
debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based
approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos
enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability
and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical
advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

*Dong Wang,Hanmo You,Lingwei Zhu,Kaiwei Lin,Zheng Chen,Chen Yang,Junji Yu,Zan Wang,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic mapping of RL applications in software engineering, analyzing 115 studies to identify trends, challenges, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of software systems and automation demands motivate integrating RL into SE, but no comprehensive survey of this field exists.

Method: A systematic review of 115 peer-reviewed SE papers across 22 top venues since DRL's introduction in 2015, analyzing trends, algorithms, datasets, model design, and evaluation practices.

Result: Identified RL4SE application categories, algorithm trends, and evaluation challenges; provided insights into dataset usage and model optimization.

Conclusion: This survey establishes a foundational framework for RL in SE, highlights open challenges, and offers future directions to advance research and practice.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for sequential
decision-making and has attracted growing interest across various domains,
particularly following the advent of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in 2015.
Simultaneously, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
further fueled interest in integrating RL with LLMs to enable more adaptive and
intelligent systems. In the field of software engineering (SE), the increasing
complexity of systems and the rising demand for automation have motivated
researchers to apply RL to a broad range of tasks, from software design and
development to quality assurance and maintenance. Despite growing research in
RL-for-SE, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic survey of
this evolving field. To address this gap, we reviewed 115 peer-reviewed studies
published across 22 premier SE venues since the introduction of DRL. We
conducted a comprehensive analysis of publication trends, categorized SE topics
and RL algorithms, and examined key factors such as dataset usage, model design
and optimization, and evaluation practices. Furthermore, we identified open
challenges and proposed future research directions to guide and inspire ongoing
work in this evolving area. To summarize, this survey offers the first
systematic mapping of RL applications in software engineering, aiming to
support both researchers and practitioners in navigating the current landscape
and advancing the field. Our artifacts are publicly available:

### [15] [When Retriever Meets Generator: A Joint Model for Code Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12558)
*Tien P. T. Le,Anh M. T. Bui,Huy N. D. Pham,Alessio Bucaioni,Phuong T. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RAGSum is a retrieval-augmented code comment generation framework that tightly couples retrieval and generation using a CodeT5 backbone model and a composite loss function, achieving state-of-the-art performance across three programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented code comment generation methods optimize retrieval and generation processes separately, leading to noise propagation from irrelevant code snippet neighbors. This decoupling limits effectiveness and efficiency in comment automation.

Method: RAGSum uses a single CodeT5 model for both retrieval and generation. It first pre-trains code embeddings with contrastive learning for better nearest-neighbor search, then employs end-to-end training with a composite loss that (1) rewards accurate top-k retrieval and (2) minimizes generation error. A lightweight self-refinement loop further optimizes output quality.

Result: On cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), RAGSum outperformed three established baselines by significant margins in BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L metrics.

Conclusion: Tightly coupling retrieval and generation through shared model parameters and joint optimization lifts the performance ceiling for code comment automation. This approach warrants further replication and qualitative studies with developers.

Abstract: Automatically generating concise, informative comments for source code can
lighten documentation effort and accelerate program comprehension.
Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments
and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically
optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise
downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with
the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is
built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We
report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on
CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for
nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a
composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes
comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop
is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three
cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three
well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially
outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These
findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the
ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and
qualitative developer studies.

### [16] [ROSE: Transformer-Based Refactoring Recommendation for Architectural Smells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12561)
*Samal Nursapa,Anastassiya Samuilova,Alessio Bucaioni. Phuong T. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper uses CodeBERT and CodeT5 to recommend refactorings for architectural smells in Java code, achieving high accuracy with CodeT5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools detect architectural smells but rarely suggest fixes. Automated refactoring recommendations could improve software maintainability and address this gap.

Method: Frame smell refactoring as a three-class classification task. Fine-tuned CodeBERT/CodeT5 on 2+ million instances from 11,149 open-source Java projects, evaluating via accuracy/F1 metrics.

Result: CodeT5 achieved 96.9% accuracy and 95.2% F1 score, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines in refactoring recommendation effectiveness.

Conclusion: Transformer models effectively connect smell detection to actionable fixes. Open licensing of code/models/data supports reproducibility and future research in automated refactoring systems.

Abstract: Architectural smells such as God Class, Cyclic Dependency, and Hub-like
Dependency degrade software quality and maintainability. Existing tools detect
such smells but rarely suggest how to fix them. This paper explores the use of
pre-trained transformer models--CodeBERT and CodeT5--for recommending suitable
refactorings based on detected smells. We frame the task as a three-class
classification problem and fine-tune both models on over 2 million refactoring
instances mined from 11,149 open-source Java projects. CodeT5 achieves 96.9%
accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines. Our
results show that transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap
between smell detection and actionable repair, laying the foundation for future
refactoring recommendation systems. We release all code, models, and data under
an open license to support reproducibility and further research.

### [17] [QSpark: Towards Reliable Qiskit Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12642)
*Kiana Kheiri,Aamna Aamir,Andriy Miranskyy,Chen Ding*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Fine-tuning a 32B model with GRPO and ORPO improves Qiskit code quality compared to existing LLMs, achieving 56.29% and 49% on Qiskit HumanEval respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum circuits require error-resilient code, but current LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and StarCoder produce flawed Qiskit code.

Method: The authors fine-tuned a 32B model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) with a synthetic dataset for quantum programming tasks.

Result: ORPO achieves 56.29% (≈+10 pp over Granite-8B-QK) on Qiskit HumanEval and 65.90% on original HumanEval, while GRPO gets 49% and 63.00% respectively, excelling in basic and intermediate tasks but neither handles advanced ones.

Conclusion: GRPO and ORPO show significant improvements in quantum code generation but face challenges with advanced tasks, indicating progression in AI-assisted quantum programming with remaining gaps.

Abstract: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and
StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned a 32 B model with two
RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference
Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit
HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29\% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over
Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49\%, both beating all general-purpose baselines;
on the original HumanEval they score 65.90\% and 63.00\%. GRPO excels on basic
tasks (42/54), ORPO on intermediate ones (41/68), and neither solves the five
advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted
quantum programming.

### [18] [A Three-Phase Evaluation Approach for new Information and Data Models in the Smart Grid Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12649)
*Christine van Stiphoudt,Sergio Potenciano Menci,Gilbert Fridgen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a three-phase evaluation approach combining explicit and implicit methods to assess newly designed information and data models in smart grids, addressing the lack of clear design phase evaluations in existing practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitalisation of smart grids necessitates robust evaluation of new information/data models during design to prevent operational disruptions. Existing approaches are either too high-level (explicit) or focus on operational testing (implicit), with no hybrid method providing clear design-phase steps.

Method: Design science research is used to develop a three-phase evaluation approach. The method integrates both explicit (theoretical) and implicit (practical testing) techniques, tested and refined through the development of an industrial flexibility model.

Result: The proposed hybrid approach is validated through application to an industrial flexibility model, with documented lessons learned on improving evaluation clarity and applicability during the design process.

Conclusion: The three-phase hybrid evaluation method fills a critical gap in smart grid model design by aligning theoretical rigor with practical validation, offering a replicable framework for future model development.

Abstract: The ongoing digitalisation of the smart grid is resulting in an increase in
automated information exchanges across distributed energy systems. This process
has led to the development of new information and data models when the existing
ones fall short. To prevent potential disruptions caused by flaws in the newly
designed information and data models, it is essential to evaluate them during
the design process before they are implemented in operation.
  Currently, general explicit evaluation approaches outside the smart grid
domain stay at a high level without defining clear steps. Meanwhile, implicit
evaluation approaches in the smart grid domain focus on testing systems that
utilise information and data models already in use for functionality in terms
of conformance and interoperability. Notably, no combination of explicit and
implicit evaluation approaches for newly designed information and data models
offers a clearly defined set of steps during their design process in the smart
grid context.
  Consequently, we design a three-phase evaluation approach using design
science research to address this gap. Our evaluation approach combines explicit
and implicit evaluation methods and is applicable when developing new
information and data models. We use the development of an information model and
data model focused on industrial flexibility descriptions to refine our
evaluation approach. Additionally, we provide lessons learned from our
experience.

### [19] [A Fuzzy Approach to Project Success: Measuring What Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12653)
*João Granja-Correia,Remedios Hernández-Linares,Luca Ferranti,Arménio Rego*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system to evaluate project success, prioritizing sustained user impact over traditional metrics like stakeholder satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Likert-scale project success measures fail to account for the context-dependent, multifaceted nature of success and over-emphasize secondary outcomes.

Method: Integrated fuzzy logic into an existing project success framework using a hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani system to prioritize enduring positive user outcomes dynamically.

Result: The approach is theorized to provide a more accurate, context-sensitive evaluation of project success with potential adaptability for complex assessments.

Conclusion: The fuzzy logic method offers promising advantages for project success evaluation and merits empirical validation alongside exploration of applications in social science research.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to project success evaluation by
integrating fuzzy logic into an existing construct. Traditional Likert-scale
measures often overlook the context-dependent and multifaceted nature of
project success. The proposed hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system
prioritizes sustained positive impact for end-users, reducing emphasis on
secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction and internal project success.
This dynamic approach may provide a more accurate measure of project success
and could be adaptable to complex evaluations. Future research will focus on
empirical testing and broader applications of fuzzy logic in social science.

### [20] [Single Conversation Methodology: A Human-Centered Protocol for AI-Assisted Software Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12665)
*Salvador D. Escobedo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The Single Conversation Methodology (SCM) introduces a structured, persistent dialogue framework for software development with LLMs, emphasizing developer control over ad hoc generative AI interactions. It focuses on cognitive clarity, traceability, and modularity across project stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current software development practices using LLMs often rely on fragmented, ad hoc interactions which may lead to reduced developer agency and maintainability. SCM addresses this by providing a coherent, traceable, and modular approach within a single conversation.

Method: SCM operationalizes software development through six sequential phases (requirements gathering to deployment) within a long-context LLM conversation. Each phase integrates specific best practices for documentation, modularity, error tracking, and iterative refinement.

Result: The authors present SCM's formal process structure and demonstrate its advantages through hypothetical project examples. They show how a continuous conversation enhances context awareness and reduces knowledge fragmentation in LLM-assisted development.

Conclusion: SCM repositions developers as architects and supervisors rather than passive users of LLM tools, offering a principled alternative to disorganized workflows while maintaining the benefits of generative AI in software development.

Abstract: We propose the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a novel and pragmatic
approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). In
contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured
and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from
requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single,
long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of
cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its
phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers
a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current
practices. We aim to reassert the active role of the developer as architect and
supervisor of the intelligent tool.

### [21] [Investigating the Performance of Small Language Models in Detecting Test Smells in Manual Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13035)
*Keila Lucas,Rohit Gheyi,Márcio Ribeiro,Fabio Palomba,Luana Martins,Elvys Soares*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores using Small Language Models (SLMs) like Phi-4, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 to detect test smells in manual test cases. Phi-4 outperforms others with a 97% pass@2 accuracy, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving test quality improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual test cases often contain test smells (e.g., ambiguity, redundancy) that reduce test quality, but existing detection tools lack scalability and require labor-intensive rule definitions. Automated solutions are needed to address these limitations effectively.

Method: The authors evaluated three SLMs (Gemma3, Llama3.2, Phi-4) on 143 real-world Ubuntu test cases, targeting seven types of test smells. They measured detection accuracy using pass@2 metrics and analyzed the models' ability to autonomously explain issues and suggest fixes without explicit prompts.

Result: Phi-4 achieved a 97% pass@2 accuracy in identifying test smells. Gemma3 and Llama3.2 reached ~91%. All models could autonomously explain detected flaws and propose actionable improvements, reducing reliance on manual rules and syntactic analysis.

Conclusion: SLMs demonstrate strong potential for efficient, cost-effective test smell detection and improvement, enabling test maintainability while preserving data privacy. This approach offers a scalable alternative to traditional rule-based or syntactic tools for enhancing test case quality in real-world settings.

Abstract: Manual testing, in which testers follow natural language instructions to
validate system behavior, remains crucial for uncovering issues not easily
captured by automation. However, these test cases often suffer from test
smells, quality issues such as ambiguity, redundancy, or missing checks that
reduce test reliability and maintainability. While detection tools exist, they
typically require manual rule definition and lack scalability. This study
investigates the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) for automatically
detecting test smells. We evaluate Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4 on 143
real-world Ubuntu test cases, covering seven types of test smells. Phi-4
achieved the best results, reaching a pass@2 of 97% in detecting sentences with
test smells, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 reached approximately 91%. Beyond
detection, SLMs autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements, even
without explicit prompt instructions. They enabled low-cost, concept-driven
identification of diverse test smells without relying on extensive rule
definitions or syntactic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of
SLMs as efficient tools that preserve data privacy and can improve test quality
in real-world scenarios.

### [22] [iReDev: A Knowledge-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Intelligent Requirements Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13081)
*Dongming Jin,Weisong Sun,Jiangping Huang,Peng Liang,Jifeng Xuan,Yang Liu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes iReDev, a knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirements development that supports stakeholder collaboration, human knowledge integration, and event-driven operations with a human-in-the-loop mechanism, demonstrating superior performance over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional requirements development is time-consuming and labor-intensive, while existing multi-agent systems provide limited support for this phase by neglecting human knowledge injection and human-agent collaboration.

Method: iReDev uses six knowledge-driven agents, an artifact pool-based event-driven communication mechanism, and a human-in-the-loop design to simulate stakeholder interactions and autonomously handle new requirements.

Result: Evaluation results show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in generating software requirements specifications across multiple dimensions.

Conclusion: The paper establishes iReDev as an effective framework for intelligent requirements development and proposes three key future research directions to advance the field.

Abstract: Requirements development is a critical phase as it is responsible for
providing a clear understanding of what stakeholders need. It involves
collaboration among stakeholders to extract explicit requirements and address
potential conflicts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently,
multi-agent systems for software development have attracted much attention.
However, existing research provides limited support for requirements
development and overlooks the injection of human knowledge into agents and the
human-agent collaboration. % To address these issues, this paper proposes a
knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development,
named iReDev. iReDev features: iReDev consists of six knowledge-driven agents
to support the entire requirements development. They collaboratively perform
various tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses
on integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world
stakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an
artifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger
the next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new
requirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to
support human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align
with the expectations of stakeholders. We evaluated the generated artifacts and
results show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in multiple aspects. We
further envision three key directions and hope this work can facilitate the
development of intelligent requirements development.

*Dongming Jin,Zhi Jin,Linyu Li,Xiaohong Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the challenges of requirements engineering in software systems using large pretrained models and proposes a new conceptual framework along with research directions to address these challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained models challenge traditional assumptions in requirements engineering (functional decomposability and behavioral predictability) due to their ambiguous capability boundaries, context-dependent behavior, and continuous evolution.

Method: The authors investigate the emergent characteristics of pretrained-model-enabled systems and propose a conceptual framework tailored to their requirements engineering, supported by three pillars and research directions.

Result: The paper outlines three promising research directions: model-specific requirements engineering techniques, contextual modeling for system behavior, and continuous evolution management strategies for requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a vision for rethinking requirements engineering methodologies to support future software systems incorporating pretrained models, guiding both researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Recent advances in large pretrained models have led to their widespread
integration as core components in modern software systems. The trend is
expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Unlike traditional software
systems governed by deterministic logic, systems powered by pretrained models
exhibit distinctive and emergent characteristics, such as ambiguous capability
boundaries, context-dependent behavior, and continuous evolution. These
properties fundamentally challenge long-standing assumptions in requirements
engineering, including functional decomposability and behavioral
predictability. This paper investigates this problem and advocates for a
rethinking of existing requirements engineering methodologies. We propose a
conceptual framework tailored to requirements engineering of
pretrained-model-enabled software systems and outline several promising
research directions within this framework. This vision helps provide a guide
for researchers and practitioners to tackle the emerging challenges in
requirements engineering of pretrained-model-enabled systems.

### [24] [Inferring Attributed Grammars from Parser Implementations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13117)
*Andreas Pointner,Josef Pichler,Herbert Prähofer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to infer attributed grammars from parser implementations by dynamically analyzing recursive descent parsers, enabling the recovery of both syntactic and semantic input processing specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete or outdated specifications in software systems that handle structured inputs leave the semantic processing aspects under-specified, limiting the effectiveness of grammar mining techniques that recover only syntactic structures.

Method: The approach dynamically analyzes recursive descent parser implementations while following a given input grammar, mapping runtime behavior to grammar rules to extract and embed semantic actions as attributed grammars.

Result: The technique was validated on an initial set of programs, showing accurate reproduction of their input processing behavior through generated attributed grammars.

Conclusion: This method enables comprehensive specification recovery by systematically linking program behavior to grammar rules, providing a practical solution for documenting complex input processing semantics.

Abstract: Software systems that process structured inputs often lack complete and
up-to-date specifications, which specify the input syntax and the semantics of
input processing. While grammar mining techniques have focused on recovering
syntactic structures, the semantics of input processing remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for inferring
attributed grammars from parser implementations. Given an input grammar, our
technique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers
to reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in
specifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program
executions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we
systematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This
enables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of
our approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately
reproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars.

### [25] [Detecting LLM-generated Code with Subtle Modification by Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13123)
*Xin Yin,Xinrui Li,Chao Ni,Xiaodan Xu,Xiaohu Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeGPTSensor+ enhances adversarial robustness for detecting LLM-generated code under minor modifications, achieved through the MIST module for adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods lack robustness against modified LLM-generated code, which is crucial for addressing real-world compliance and copyright issues.

Method: The approach uses adversarial training with a novel MIST module to generate structured adversarial samples, improving model resilience to code alterations like variable renaming and structural adjustments.

Result: CodeGPTSensor+ achieves significantly higher detection accuracy on adversarial test sets (HMCorp dataset) while maintaining high performance on original code compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: CodeGPTSensor+ provides a robust solution for LLM code detection in practical scenarios, advancing responsible AI usage in software development.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their powerful
code-generation capabilities have been widely applied in tasks like code
completion and automated development, demonstrating the value of improving
coding efficiency. However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises
several new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code
provenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly
concerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its
compliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the
other hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to
manual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments.
Although some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods
for detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness
when facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective
solution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may
undergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of
CodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against
input perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation
module, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which
systematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial
samples. This module effectively enhances the model's resistance against
diverse adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the HMCorp dataset
demonstrate that CodeGPTSensor+ significantly improves detection accuracy on
the adversarial test set while maintaining high accuracy on the original test
set, showcasing superior robustness compared to CodeGPTSensor.
