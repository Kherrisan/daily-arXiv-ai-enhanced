### [1] [MGC: A Compiler Framework Exploiting Compositional Blindness in Aligned LLMs for Malware Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02057)
*Lu Yan,Zhuo Zhang,Xiangzhe Xu,Shengwei An,Guangyu Shen,Zhou Xuan,Xuan Chen,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a framework that systematically decomposes malicious software tasks into benign-appearing sub-tasks to circumvent AI alignment safeguards, achieving superior correctness rates compared to existing malware generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI alignment mechanisms for large language models (LLMs) fail to address the risk of malicious operations being executed via modular decomposition into innocuous components, creating a critical vulnerability in software security.

Method: MGC leverages a specialized Malware Description Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to translate high-level malicious intents into aligned code snippets, enabling compositional attacks through subtask abstraction and modular code generation.

Result: Experiments show MGC outperforms jailbreaking methods by 365.79% and underground services by 78.07% in code correctness across benchmark datasets. It successfully reproduces and enhances 16 real-world malware samples through modular decomposition.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates significant risks in aligned AI systems when faced with compositional attacks, providing security researchers with concrete examples of how malicious software can be generated circumventing existing safeguards through modular task decomposition.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing
the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility
extends to malicious software development, raising significant security
concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent
direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly
evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability:
malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing
sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a
novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition
and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description
Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and
benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications
and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground
services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies
further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware
samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by
exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

### [2] [Can Artificial Intelligence solve the blockchain oracle problem? Unpacking the Challenges and Possibilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02125)
*Giulio Caldarelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores how AI can address the blockchain oracle problem by enhancing data quality and system resilience through techniques like anomaly detection and reputation modeling, but emphasizes that AI cannot fully replace trust assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blockchain systems struggle to integrate reliable off-chain data (the oracle problem), limiting trustless applications despite existing architectural and economic solutions.

Method: Critical assessment of AI techniques (anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic reputation modeling, adversarial resistance) in oracle contexts through academic literature and practitioner implementations.

Result: AI improves data quality and resilience in oracle systems but cannot eliminate untrustworthy off-chain dependencies. Requires integration as a complementary layer.

Conclusion: AI should augment, not replace, trust assumptions in oracle systems by providing inference and filtering. Solutions require layered approaches combining multiple strategies.

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting
reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental
limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years
have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic
strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the
fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain
world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial
intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both
academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI
techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic
reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We
observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,
source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on
unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI
should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within
a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

### [3] [ARMOUR US: Android Runtime Zero-permission Sensor Usage Monitoring from User Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02177)
*Yan Long,Jiancong Cui,Yuqing Yang,Tobias Alam,Zhiqiang Lin,Kevin Fu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces ARMOUR, a user-space runtime monitoring system for detecting Android zero-permission sensor abuse in third-party apps without requiring rooting or complex setups, revealing privacy risks and widespread misuse patterns across 1,448 commercial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Android devices' zero-permission sensors (e.g., accelerometers) risk privacy leakage, but existing monitoring approaches face usability and technical barriers. End users and researchers lack tools to easily identify malicious sensor access in obfuscated code.

Method: ARMOUR leverages Android's intrinsic sampling rate variations and convergence behaviors for app-agnostic runtime detection. It operates in user-space, avoiding rooting privileges and static analysis limitations through dynamic, system-level monitoring.

Result: ARMOUR successfully detected sensor usage in obfuscated code, showing 50% of apps in non-sensor-focused categories accessed multiple zero-permission sensors. It operates effectively under Android's policy changes.

Conclusion: ARMOUR bridges the gap for secure zero-permission sensor monitoring, enabling both user privacy awareness and scalable security research. Remaining technical challenges and regulatory issues regarding sensor access policies require further attention.

Abstract: This work investigates how to monitor access to Android zero-permission
sensors which could cause privacy leakage to users. Moreover, monitoring such
sensitive access allows security researchers to characterize potential sensor
abuse patterns. Zero-permission sensors such as accelerometers have become an
indispensable part of Android devices. The critical information they provide
has attracted extensive research investigating how data collectors could
capture more sensor data to enable both benign and exploitative applications.
In contrast, little work has explored how to enable data providers, such as end
users, to understand sensor usage. While existing methods such as static
analysis and hooking-based dynamic analysis face challenges of requiring
complicated development chains, rooting privilege, and app-specific reverse
engineering analysis, our work aims to bridge this gap by developing ARMOUR for
user-space runtime monitoring, leveraging the intrinsic sampling rate variation
and convergence behaviors of Android. ARMOUR enables privacy-aware users to
easily monitor how third-party apps use sensor data and support security
researchers to perform rapid app-agnostic sensor access analysis. Our
evaluation with 1,448 commercial applications shows the effectiveness of ARMOUR
in detecting sensor usage in obfuscated code and other conditions, and observes
salient sensor abuse patterns such as 50% of apps from seemingly
sensor-independent categories accessing data of multiple zero-permission
sensors. We analyze the impact of Android's recent policy changes on
zero-permission sensors and remaining technical and regulatory problems.

### [4] [Extended c-differential distinguishers of full 9 and reduced-round Kuznyechik cipher](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02181)
*Pantelimon Stanica,Ranit Dutta,Bimal Mandal*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces truncated inner c-differential cryptanalysis, a practical method for analyzing block ciphers using c-differential uniformity, and demonstrates significant vulnerabilities in the 9-round Kuznyechik cipher.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior c-differential uniformity concepts (e.g., $cF(x)$) disrupted key addition in block ciphers, hindering practical application despite their theoretical importance.

Method: The authors developed \'inner\' c-differentials using $(F(cx \oplus a), F(x))$, proving duality with outer c-differentials of $F^{-1}$. They implemented a statistical-computational framework testing millions of differential pairs.

Result: Statistically significant non-randomness was found across all tested Kuznyechik round counts. For 9-round versions, bias ratios reached 1.7× and corrected p-values dropped to $1.85 \times 10^{-3}$, identifying configurations that trigger security alerts.

Conclusion: The results show insufficient security margins against this new attack vector in the full 9-round Kuznyechik cipher, representing its first practical distinguisher and motivating further analysis/improvements.

Abstract: This paper introduces {\em truncated inner $c$-differential cryptanalysis}, a
novel technique that for the first time enables the practical application of
$c$-differential uniformity to block ciphers. While Ellingsen et al. (IEEE
Trans. Inf. Theory, 2020) established the notion of $c$-differential uniformity
using $(F(x\oplus a), cF(x))$, a key challenge remained: multiplication by $c$
disrupts the structural properties essential for block cipher analysis,
particularly key addition.
  We resolve this challenge by developing an \emph{inner} $c$-differential
approach where multiplication by $c$ affects the input: $(F(cx\oplus a),
F(x))$. We prove that the inner $c$-differential uniformity of a function $F$
equals the outer $c$-differential uniformity of $F^{-1}$, establishing a
fundamental duality. This modification preserves cipher structure while
enabling practical cryptanalytic applications.
  Our main contribution is a comprehensive multi-faceted
statistical-computational framework, implementing truncated $c$-differential
analysis against the full 9-round Kuznyechik cipher (the inner
$c$-differentials are immune to the key whitening at the backend). Through
extensive computational analysis involving millions of differential pairs, we
demonstrate statistically significant non-randomness across all tested round
counts. For the full 9-round cipher, we identify multiple configurations
triggering critical security alerts, with bias ratios reaching $1.7\times$ and
corrected p-values as low as $1.85 \times 10^{-3}$, suggesting insufficient
security margin against this new attack vector. This represents the first
practical distinguisher against the full 9-round Kuznyechik.

### [5] [EIM-TRNG: Obfuscating Deep Neural Network Weights with Encoding-in-Memory True Random Number Generator via RowHammer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02206)
*Ranyang Zhou,Abeer Matar A. Almalky,Gamana Aragonda,Sabbir Ahmed,Filip Roth Trønnes-Christensen,Adnan Siraj Rakin,Shaahin Angizi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EIM-TRNG, a novel Encoding-in-Memory True Random Number Generator, utilizes RowHammer-induced DRAM cell randomness to secure DNN weights through physical entropy extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software pseudo-random number generators lack sufficient unpredictability and resilience for protecting deep neural network (DNN) parameters like weights, which are critical for AI system integrity, privacy, and intellectual property.

Method: The framework harvests entropy from RowHammer-caused bit-flips in DRAM cells through controlled operations. DNN weight encoding combines fixed and unpredictable bit-flips, while decryption uses a key derived from the statistical behavior of these bit-flips.

Result: Demonstration of reliable entropy extraction from DRAM's RowHammer effects, showing secure DNN encryption with low-cost hardware solutions and maintaining both confidentiality and model authenticity.

Conclusion: EIM-TRNG presents a robust, hardware-level approach for AI security by innovatively using DRAM's physical properties. The combination of memory disturbances and encryption strategies establishes a viable method for low-cost, entropy-rich protection of machine learning models.

Abstract: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware
security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep
NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is
critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI
systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used,
they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs.
In this work, we propose a novel and robust Encoding-in-Memory TRNG called
EIM-TRNG that leverages the inherent physical randomness in DRAM cell behavior,
particularly under RowHammer-induced disturbances, for the first time. We
demonstrate how the unpredictable bit-flips generated through carefully
controlled RowHammer operations can be harnessed as a reliable entropy source.
Furthermore, we apply this TRNG framework to secure DNN weight data by encoding
via a combination of fixed and unpredictable bit-flips. The encrypted data is
later decrypted using a key derived from the probabilistic flip behavior,
ensuring both data confidentiality and model authenticity. Our results validate
the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction for robust, low-cost
hardware security and offer a promising direction for protecting machine
learning models at the hardware level.

### [6] [Linearly Homomorphic Ring Signature Scheme over Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02281)
*Heng Guo,Kun Tian,Fengxia Liu,Zhiyong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic ring signature scheme with post-quantum security under the SIS assumption, enabling anonymous yet verifiable computations for privacy-critical applications like blockchain and secure multi-party computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems lack feasible homomorphic ring signature schemes that simultaneously provide anonymity and support verifiable homomorphic computations, creating a critical gap for applications requiring both properties, particularly those needing post-quantum security.

Method: Constructs a unified framework combining ring signature anonymity and linear homomorphic properties using lattice-based cryptography under the small integer solution (SIS) assumption in the standard model.

Result: Demonstrates provable security against insider corruption attacks with strong anonymity under full key exposure, fulfilling the dual requirements of anonymity and homomorphic verifiability through rigorous mathematical foundations.

Conclusion: This breakthrough establishes a post-quantum secure foundation for homomorphic computation applications requiring anonymity, addressing longstanding challenges in cryptographic protocol design for confidential transactions and secure data processing.

Abstract: Homomorphic ring signature schemes combine the strong anonymity of ring
signatures with the computability of homomorphic signatures, demonstrating
significant potential in scenarios requiring both anonymous data provenance and
verifiable homomorphic computation (e.g., confidential blockchain transactions
and secure multi-party computation). However, no feasible homomorphic ring
signature scheme currently exists.
  In this work, we propose the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic ring
signature scheme. Proven secure in the standard model under the small integer
solution (SIS) assumption, our scheme achieves strong anonymity under full key
exposure and unforgeability against insider corruption attacks. As the first
unified framework for ring signatures and linear homomorphic signatures, this
construction provides a post-quantum-secure solution for the aforementioned
applications, advancing the development of privacy-enhanced homomorphic
computation.

### [7] [Rethinking Broken Object Level Authorization Attacks Under Zero Trust Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02309)
*Anbin Wu,Zhiyong Feng,Ruitao Feng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces BOLAZ, a zero-trust framework to detect and prevent Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs through data-flow analysis and authorization-interval identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BOLA (ranked top in OWASP API Security) allows attackers to exploit API parameter manipulation for unauthorized access, necessitating novel defenses beyond traditional authorization models.

Method: BOLAZ uses static taint tracking to map resource ID propagation paths, categorizes APIs as producers/consumers of resource IDs, and dynamically enforces authorization boundaries based on best-practice logic.

Result: Evaluation on 10 GitHub projects revealed BOLAZ successfully defends against known CVE vulnerabilities and discovered 35 previously unidentified BOLA attack vectors in real-world systems.

Conclusion: BOLAZ demonstrates practical effectiveness as the first authorization-guided defense framework against BOLA attacks, addressing critical gaps in RESTful API security through context-aware access control enforcement.

Abstract: RESTful APIs facilitate data exchange between applications, but they also
expose sensitive resources to potential exploitation. Broken Object Level
Authorization (BOLA) is the top vulnerability in the OWASP API Security Top 10,
exemplifies a critical access control flaw where attackers manipulate API
parameters to gain unauthorized access. To address this, we propose BOLAZ, a
defense framework grounded in zero trust principles. BOLAZ analyzes the data
flow of resource IDs, pinpointing BOLA attack injection points and determining
the associated authorization intervals to prevent horizontal privilege
escalation. Our approach leverages static taint tracking to categorize APIs
into producers and consumers based on how they handle resource IDs. By mapping
the propagation paths of resource IDs, BOLAZ captures the context in which
these IDs are produced and consumed, allowing for precise identification of
authorization boundaries. Unlike defense methods based on common authorization
models, BOLAZ is the first authorization-guided method that adapts defense
rules based on the system's best-practice authorization logic. We validate
BOLAZ through empirical research on 10 GitHub projects. The results demonstrate
BOLAZ's effectiveness in defending against vulnerabilities collected from CVE
and discovering 35 new BOLA vulnerabilities in the wild, demonstrating its
practicality in real-world deployments.

### [8] [PII Jailbreaking in LLMs via Activation Steering Reveals Personal Information Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02332)
*Krishna Kanth Nakka,Xue Jiang,Xuebing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study shows adversarial activation steering can bypass LLM privacy safeguards, with 95%+ jailbreaking success and 50%+ true private information disclosure across four models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are aligned to avoid sensitive topics, but adversaries may exploit internal mechanisms to extract private data despite safeguards. This work investigates whether targeted activation manipulation can circumvent privacy alignment.

Method: 1) Trained linear probes on privacy evaluator labels to identify attention heads controlling refusal behavior
2) Steered a small subset of these identified heads to modify model responses
3) Tested across four LLMs to validate effectiveness of the jailbreaking method

Result: At least 95% of privacy queries produced non-refusal responses when steered. Over 50% of these responses contained verifiably true personal information (sensitive attributes, life events, relationships) that models would typically refuse to disclose.

Conclusion: LLMs memorize private information in their internal activations that can be extracted via targeted manipulation, exposing vulnerabilities in current privacy alignment mechanisms. This methodology demonstrates the risk of adversarial activation steering for sensitive data extraction.

Abstract: This paper investigates privacy jailbreaking in LLMs via steering, focusing
on whether manipulating activations can bypass LLM alignment and alter response
behaviors to privacy related queries (e.g., a certain public figure's sexual
orientation). We begin by identifying attention heads predictive of refusal
behavior for private attributes (e.g., sexual orientation) using lightweight
linear probes trained with privacy evaluator labels. Next, we steer the
activations of a small subset of these attention heads guided by the trained
probes to induce the model to generate non-refusal responses. Our experiments
show that these steered responses often disclose sensitive attribute details,
along with other private information about data subjects such as life events,
relationships, and personal histories that the models would typically refuse to
produce. Evaluations across four LLMs reveal jailbreaking disclosure rates of
at least 95%, with more than 50% on average of these responses revealing true
personal information. Our controlled study demonstrates that private
information memorized in LLMs can be extracted through targeted manipulation of
internal activations.

### [9] [Evaluating Language Models For Threat Detection in IoT Security Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02390)
*Jorge J. Tejero-Fernández,Alfonso Sánchez-Macián*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pipeline using fine-tuned open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect anomalies and recommend mitigations for IoT security logs, surpassing classical machine learning baselines in multi-class attack classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cybersecurity threats in IoT networks require advanced log analysis methods. Traditional machine learning (ML) models face limitations in capturing context and handling complex multiclass anomaly detection, motivating the exploration of LLM-based approaches.

Method: The study evaluates three open-source LLMs through three strategies (zero-shot, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning) on a dataset of IoT logs. Classical ML classifiers (baseline) are compared against LLMs for both binary and multiclass anomaly detection tasks. Threats are mapped to MITRE CAPEC, and the models are fine-tuned to generate IoT-specific mitigation recommendations.

Result: LLMs outperformed classical ML baselines in multiclass attack classification. Fine-tuning and mitigation strategy implementation enabled the models to provide integrated detection-recommendation guidance, demonstrating practical effectiveness for IoT security.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs show superior capability for multiclass IoT log anomaly detection and offer actionable mitigation recommendations when aligned with frameworks like MITRE CAPEC, presenting a promising approach for proactive cybersecurity defense in IoT environments.

Abstract: Log analysis is a relevant research field in cybersecurity as they can
provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and
systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security
logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three
open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with
three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT
dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the
corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC,
defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models
with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and
recommendation guidance.

### [10] [CyberRAG: An agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424)
*Francesco Blefari,Cristian Cosentino,Francesco Aurelio Pironti,Angelo Furfaro,Fabrizio Marozzo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CyberRAG is an agent-based RAG framework that addresses alert overload in enterprise networks by combining modular classifiers, iterative retrieval, and explainable threat-labeling for high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large enterprises face overwhelming cybersecurity alerts with conventional systems producing high false-positives and lacking explainability, requiring scalable, accurate, and interpretable solutions.

Method: The framework uses an LLM agent to orchestrate (1) specialized ML classifiers for attack families, (2) tool adapters for enrichment/alerting, and (3) iterative retrieval from a knowledge base for self-consistent evidence. Modular design allows easy extension with new classifiers without agent retraining.

Result: Achieved 94.92% final classification accuracy via semantic orchestration, 94% per-class accuracy, 0.94 BERTScore for explanations, and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation.

Conclusion: CyberRAG demonstrates agentic RAG can deliver both high detection accuracy and SOC-ready explanations, enabling semi-autonomous cyber-defense workflows in enterprise-scale environments.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can
generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security
analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise.
Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield
high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to
justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,
a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,
explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent
orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to
a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and
(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a
domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and
self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic
design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This
agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language
justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing
interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be
supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.
CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing
final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.
Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based
expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can
pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a
practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.

### [11] [Effectively Identifying Wi-Fi Devices through State Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02478)
*Melissa Safari,Abhishek K. Mishra,Mathieu Cunche*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Wi-Fi device fingerprinting framework using behavioral dynamics from all management frames (not just probe requests), modeling devices as finite state machines with matrix-based features encoding structural and temporal characteristics. It achieves 86%+ identification accuracy in real-world environments, significantly outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAC address randomization association techniques relying solely on probe requests lack robustness in dense environments with high device mobility due to unstable signatures from sporadic probe activity.

Method: 1) Models device behavior as finite state machines using passively observed management frames. 2) Encodes state transition frequencies (structural) and inter-state timing delays (temporal) into matrix representations. 3) Converts matrices into compact feature vectors for efficient similarity comparison. 4) Applies temporal burst aggregation for accuracy enhancement.

Result: Achieved 86%+ device identification accuracy using only management frames without any randomization, with further improvements through temporal aggregation. Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in diverse real-world deployments demonstrating unique and consistent  device characterization at scale.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, mobile-friendly alternative to probe-based device fingerprinting by leveraging the full spectrum of management frame dynamics, enabling scalable and accurate identification even in highly dynamic Wi-Fi environments.

Abstract: Wi-Fi management frames reveal structured communication patterns that persist
even under randomization of MAC addresses. Prior approaches to associating
randomized MAC addresses with devices primarily focus on probe requests,
overlooking the broader set of management frames and their transition dynamics.
This narrow focus limits their robustness in dense, real-world environments
with high device mobility, where probe activity alone fails to yield stable and
distinctive signatures. In this paper, we present a novel framework for
fingerprinting Wi-Fi devices based on behavioral dynamics extracted from
passively observed management frames. We model each device's behavior as a
finite state machine and introduce matrix-based representations that encode
both structural (state transition frequencies) and temporal (inter-state
delays) characteristics. These matrices are embedded into compact feature
vectors, enabling efficient similarity comparison. Through extensive evaluation
in diverse real-world settings, our method achieves over 86% identification
accuracy for non-randomized devices using only Wi-Fi management frames, with
further improvements observed through temporal burst aggregation. Our findings
are sufficient to uniquely and consistently characterize devices at scale,
outperforming the state-of-the-art.

### [12] [A 10-bit S-box generated by Feistel construction from cellular automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02489)
*Thomas Prévost,Bruno Martin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new 10-bit S-box using a Feistel construction with a 5-cell cellular automaton and affine transformations, demonstrating security properties comparable to or exceeding the AES S-box.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a larger, cryptographically strong S-box that could enhance or replace 5-bit substitutions in lightweight ciphers like ASCON, leveraging pseudorandomness and empirical optimization for better security.

Method: The authors employed a Feistel network with subpermutations generated by a 5-cell cellular automaton under an empirically selected rule and bijective affine transformations. The cellular automaton rule and Feistel layout were chosen through empirical testing of pseudorandom output quality and S-box performance.

Result: The generated 10-bit S-box achieved security properties comparable to or superior to the AES S-box, as validated by cryptanalysis in the paper.

Conclusion: The proposed S-box represents a viable advancement for lightweight cryptographic applications, potentially offering improved security for 5-bit substitution-based ciphers like ASCON through its empirically optimized design.

Abstract: We propose a new 10-bit S-box generated from a Feistel construction. The
subpermutations are generated by a 5-cell cellular automaton based on a unique
well-chosen rule and bijective affine transformations. In particular, the
cellular automaton rule is chosen based on empirical tests of its ability to
generate good pseudorandom output on a ring cellular automaton. Similarly,
Feistel's network layout is based on empirical data regarding the quality of
the output S-box. We perform cryptanalysis of the generated 10-bit S-box, and
we find security properties comparable to or sometimes even better than those
of the standard AES S-box. We believe that our S-box could be used to replace
the 5-bit substitution of ciphers like ASCON.

### [14] [Alleviating Attack Data Scarcity: SCANIA's Experience Towards Enhancing In-Vehicle Cyber Security Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02607)
*Frida Sundfeldt,Bianca Widstam,Mahshid Helali Moghadam,Kuo-Yun Liang,Anders Vesterberg*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a context-aware attack data generator for vehicular networks that creates high-fidelity attack scenarios (DoS, spoofing, replay, etc.) to enhance intrusion detection system training amid real-world attack data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connected vehicles’ digital evolution creates urgent security needs, but testing with real attack scenarios is limited by safety, cost, and ethical constraints, requiring synthetic data generation. Existing methods lack scalability and realism for evolving threats.

Method: We developed a parameterized attack data generator using CAN message decoding and intensity adjustment mechanisms to produce attack inputs and network logs. Two deep neural network intrusion detection models were trained and evaluated using the generated data to validate its effectiveness.

Result: The generated data achieved high detection accuracy (over 95%) in intrusion detection models, demonstrating its capability to represent diverse attack types (DoS, fuzzy, spoofing, etc.) while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: This context-aware generator provides practical, high-fidelity synthetic attack data for vehicular intrusion detection systems. The study highlights implementation factors influencing data realism and confirms its effectiveness in training accurate detection models.

Abstract: The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks
emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures
such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of
attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms
that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of
ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on
implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and
ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack
scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective
methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper
presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and
corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,
representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,
spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack
models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to
configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and
promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated
attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,
in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural
network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and
scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high
detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also
elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world
scenarios and provide insights into its application.

*Mao Luo,Zhi Wang,Yiwen Huang,Qingyun Zhang,Zhouxing Su,Zhipeng Lv,Wen Hu,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in manually constructed verification rules for electronic payment platforms and proposes a systematic approach to enhance their robustness against exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring robust verification rules is critical to prevent financial losses and security breaches in high-volume transaction environments.

Method: The paper introduces a systematic approach (not explicitly detailed) to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in expert-written verification rules.

Result: The systematic approach addresses imperfections in manually created rules, reducing the risk of malicious requests bypassing them.

Conclusion: Vigilance against rule vulnerabilities through systematic methods is essential for maintaining security in electronic payment ecosystems.

Abstract: Electronic payment platforms are estimated to process billions oftransactions
daily, with the cumulative value of these transactionspotentially reaching into
the trillions. Even a minor error within thishigh-volume environment could
precipitate substantial financiallosses. To mitigate this risk, manually
constructed verification rules,developed by domain experts, are typically
employed to identifyand scrutinize transactions in production environments.
However,due to the absence of a systematic approach to ensure the robust-ness
of these verification rules against vulnerabilities, they remainsusceptible to
exploitation.To mitigate this risk, manually constructed verification rules,
de-veloped by domain experts, are typically employed to identify andscrutinize
transactions in production environments. However, dueto the absence of a
systematic approach to ensure the robustness ofthese verification rules against
vulnerabilities, they remain suscep-tible to exploitation. To ensure data
security, database maintainersusually compose complex verification rules to
check whether aquery/update request is valid. However, the rules written by
ex-perts are usually imperfect, and malicious requests may bypassthese rules.
As a result, the demand for identifying the defects ofthe rules systematically
emerges.

### [16] [Control at Stake: Evaluating the Security Landscape of LLM-Driven Email Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02699)
*Jiangrong Wu,Yuhong Nan,Jianliang Wu,Zitong Yao,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper identifies critical security vulnerabilities in LLM email agent apps through the proposed Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, demonstrating all 1,404 tested instances can be hijacked in 2.03 attempts on average, with some requiring as few as 1.23 attempts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM email agents, which manage sensitive communications using external APIs, have unexplored security risks despite widespread deployment. No prior study has systematically investigated these vulnerabilities.

Method: We developed EAHawk, a pipeline to systematically evaluate EAH attacks across 14 LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps, 12 LLMs, and 20 email services, generating 1,404 real-world email agent instances for testing.

Result: 100% of tested instances were successfully hijacked; the average number of attacks required for control was 2.03. For certain LLMs, the average dropped to 1.23 attempts, indicating severe vulnerability.

Conclusion: Current email agent systems lack robust security mechanisms to prevent prompt override via external emails. The EAH attack highlights the urgent need for enhanced protections against unauthorized control of LLM agents.

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of LLMs have led to the rapid proliferation of
LLM agent apps, where developers enhance LLMs with access to external resources
to support complex task execution. Among these, LLM email agent apps represent
one of the widely used categories, as email remains a critical communication
medium for users. LLM email agents are capable of managing and responding to
email using LLM-driven reasoning and autonomously executing user instructions
via external email APIs (e.g., send email). However, despite their growing
deployment and utility, the security mechanism of LLM email agent apps remains
underexplored. Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential
security risk within these agent apps and their broader implications.
  In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of
LLM email agents. We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which
overrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources,
allowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further
perform specific attack scenarios without user awareness.
  To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to
evaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps. By EAHawk, we performed an
empirical study spanning 14 representative LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps,
12 LLMs, and 20 email services, which led to the generation of 1,404 real-world
email agent instances for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that all
1,404 instances were successfully hijacked; on average, only 2.03 attack
attempts are required to control an email agent instance. Even worse, for some
LLMs, the average number of attempts needed to achieve full agent control drops
to as few as 1.23.

### [17] [Quantifying Classifier Utility under Local Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02727)
*Ye Zheng,Yidan Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to quantify classifier utility under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) by linking perturbation concentration analysis with classifier robustness analysis, demonstrating that piecewise-based mechanisms improve utility and aligning theoretical results with empirical observations in low-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The theoretical challenge of quantifying how LDP-induced data perturbations affect the utility of complex or black-box classifiers

Method: A framework treating LDP mechanisms as distributional functions and classifiers as black-box functions, leveraging concentration probability of LDP perturbations to transform utility analysis into robustness analysis within a concentrated region. Combined with two novel refinement techniques.

Result: Theoretical utility quantification matching empirical results closely for typical LDP-mechanism and classifier combinations, particularly in low-dimensional input spaces, and demonstrating superiority of piecewise-based mechanisms over alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a generalizable way to quantify and improve classifier utility under LDP, guiding mechanism and parameter selection, with practical validation showing effectiveness in low-dimensional contexts.

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) provides a rigorous and quantifiable privacy
guarantee for personal data by introducing perturbation at the data source.
However, quantifying the impact of these perturbations on classifier utility
remains a theoretical challenge, particularly for complex or black-box
classifiers.
  This paper presents a framework for theoretically quantifying classifier
utility under LDP mechanisms. The key insight is that LDP perturbation is
concentrated around the original data with a specific probability, transforming
utility analysis of the classifier into its robustness analysis in this
concentrated region. Our framework connects the concentration analysis of LDP
mechanisms with the robustness analysis of classifiers. It treats LDP
mechanisms as general distributional functions and classifiers as black-box
functions, thus applicable to any LDP mechanism and classifier. A direct
application of our utility quantification is guiding the selection of LDP
mechanisms and privacy parameters for a given classifier. Notably, our analysis
shows that a piecewise-based mechanism leads to better utility compared to
alternatives in common scenarios.
  Using this framework alongside two novel refinement techniques, we conduct
case studies on utility quantification for typical mechanism-classifier
combinations. The results demonstrate that our theoretical utility
quantification aligns closely with empirical observations, particularly when
classifiers operate in lower-dimensional input spaces.

*Sizhe Chen,Arman Zharmagambetov,David Wagner,Chuan Guo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Meta SecAlign is the first open-source LLM with built-in commercial-grade defense against prompt injection attacks, achieving state-of-the-art robustness and utility comparable to closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-level defenses against prompt injection attacks are closed-source and inaccessible to the AI security community; open research collaboration is essential for advancing mitigation strategies.

Method: Developed Meta SecAlign using an improved SOTA SecAlign defense training recipe on a generic instruction-tuning dataset, validated through 9 utility and 7 security benchmarks.

Result: Meta-SecAlign-70B demonstrates robustness against prompt injection attacks while maintaining competitiveness with closed-source commercial LLMs in utility metrics like instruction-following, tool-calling, and web navigation tasks.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs with high-security standards like Meta SecAlign can bridge research gaps and match commercial capabilities, enabling collaborative development of security solutions.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated
applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are
currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We
believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where
co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific
progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we
develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in
model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We
provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved
version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7
security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic
instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,
including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general
instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable
utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

*Artur Zolkowski,Kei Nishimura-Gasparian,Robert McCarthy,Roland S. Zimmermann,David Lindner*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper assesses steganography capabilities in LLMs for evading monitoring, finding limited current ability but potential concerning future developments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand risks of LLM output misalignment through hidden encoding, requiring evaluation of stealth capabilities under different affordances.

Method: Tests frontier LLMs with two steganographic scenarios: 1) encoding covert messages in responses and 2) performing hidden reasoning using schemes like Hexadecimal, under standard vs. enhanced affordance conditions.

Result: Models fail to encode short messages under standard monitoring but succeed with additional tools (scratchpads/scheme coordination). Show limited basic encoded reasoning ability in simple tasks but cannot subtly hide such reasoning in cover output.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have nascent steganographic abilities insufficient to bypass robust monitoring, but future models may develop more sophisticated evasion techniques requiring advanced detection methods.

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

*Zhongshu Gu,Enriquillo Valdez,Salman Ahmed,Julian James Stephen,Michael Le,Hani Jamjoom,Shixuan Zhao,Zhiqiang Lin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes NVIDIA's GPU Confidential Computing (GPU-CC) system, uncovering its security challenges and inner workings through open-source instrumentation and responsible disclosure of findings to address proprietary complexity and support secure AI adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency in NVIDIA's GPU-CC ecosystem creates difficulties for security researchers to evaluate its robustness, especially as it extends trust boundaries to GPUs for sensitive AI workloads.

Method: The authors synthesized fragmented information, instrumented the GPU kernel module (the only open-source component), conducted experiments to identify vulnerabilities, and proposed speculative reasoning for inaccessible components.

Result: Responsible reporting of security weaknesses to NVIDIA PSIRT, with identified exploits and operational insights derived from instrumentation and experimental analysis of the GPU kernel module.

Conclusion: The work provides a roadmap for understanding GPU-CC’s architecture, emphasizes the need for transparent design in confidentiality systems, and contributes to securing AI workloads over heterogeneous platforms.

Abstract: GPU Confidential Computing (GPU-CC) was introduced as part of the NVIDIA
Hopper Architecture, extending the trust boundary beyond traditional CPU-based
confidential computing. This innovation enables GPUs to securely process AI
workloads, providing a robust and efficient solution for handling sensitive
data. For end users, transitioning to GPU-CC mode is seamless, requiring no
modifications to existing AI applications. However, this ease of adoption
contrasts sharply with the complexity of the underlying proprietary systems.
The lack of transparency presents significant challenges for security
researchers seeking a deeper understanding of GPU-CC's architecture and
operational mechanisms.
  The challenges of analyzing the NVIDIA GPU-CC system arise from a scarcity of
detailed specifications, the proprietary nature of the ecosystem, and the
complexity of product design. In this paper, we aim to demystify the
implementation of NVIDIA GPU-CC system by piecing together the fragmented and
incomplete information disclosed from various sources. Our investigation begins
with a high-level discussion of the threat model and security principles before
delving into the low-level details of each system component. We instrument the
GPU kernel module -- the only open-source component of the system -- and
conduct a series of experiments to identify the security weaknesses and
potential exploits. For certain components that are out of reach through
experiments, we propose well-reasoned speculations about their inner working
mechanisms. We have responsibly reported all security findings presented in
this paper to the NVIDIA PSIRT Team.

### [21] [How do Software Engineering Candidates Prepare for Technical Interviews?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02068)
*Brian Bell,Teresa Thomas,Sang Won Lee,Chris Brown*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates how software engineering candidates prepare for technical interviews, finding that most use non-authentic methods and lack educational support, leading to stress and unpreparedness. Stakeholders need to improve interview preparation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Technical interviews are critical for software engineering jobs but poorly addressed in computing curricula. Understanding preparation methods can reduce stress and improve candidate readiness.

Method: A survey (n=131) was distributed to candidates actively preparing for technical interviews to analyze their methods and educational support.

Result: Candidates rarely practice in authentic settings, courses inadequately prepare them, and this results in high stress levels and perceived unpreparedness during interviews.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable implications for stakeholders to design better educational programs and practical training to enhance technical interview readiness for software engineering candidates.

Abstract: To obtain employment, aspiring software engineers must complete technical
interviews -- a hiring process which involves candidates writing code while
communicating to an audience. However, the complexities of tech interviews are
difficult to prepare for and seldom faced in computing curricula. To this end,
we seek to understand how candidates prepare for technical interviews,
investigating the effects of preparation methods and the role of education. We
distributed a survey to candidates (n = 131) actively preparing for technical
interviews. Our results suggest candidates rarely train in authentic settings
and courses fail to support preparation efforts -- leading to stress and
unpreparedness. Based on our findings, we provide implications for stakeholders
to enhance tech interview preparation for candidates pursuing software
engineering roles.

### [22] [Structural Code Search using Natural Language Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02107)
*Ben Limpanukorn,Yanjun Wang,Zach Patterson,Pranav Garg,Murali Krishna Ramanathan,Xiaofei Ma,Anoop Deoras,Miryung Kim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a natural language-based structural code search approach using LLMs to translate queries into DSLs like Semgrep and GQL, achieving high precision/recall and outperforming traditional baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structural code search tools rely on complex domain-specific languages (DSLs) that create a barrier for developers. Natural language queries would offer a more intuitive and accessible method for structural code search.

Method: A novel approach combining LLM reasoning with structural search DSLs, implemented for Semgrep and GQL. An LLM translates natural language queries into DSL queries for efficient code retrieval.

Result: Achieved 55%-70% precision/recall on a 400-query Java benchmark. Outperformed semantic code search (57% F1 score improvement) and LLM retrieval baselines (14% F1 score improvement).

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of using natural language and LLMs for structural code search, offering a robust solution that surpasses existing methods and reduces the learning curve for developers.

Abstract: Searching code is a common task that developers perform to understand APIs,
learn common code patterns, and navigate code. Currently, developers most
commonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and
widely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code
search tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic
structure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to
systematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools
operate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be
difficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural
language to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural
language provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to
entry.
  In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning
capabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the
power of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve
relevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search
DSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for
structural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show
that our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to
DSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision
and recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly
outperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to
57% and 14% on F1 scores.

### [23] [Can Internal Software Metrics Predict App Popularity at Launch? Yeas! and Nays!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02110)
*Md Nahidul Islam Opu,Fatima Islam Mouri,Rick Kazman,Yuanfang Cai,Shaiful Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study investigates using source code metrics and features to predict mobile app popularity before release, finding that binary classification outperforms regression and that internal metrics can be useful despite limited explanatory power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting app popularity is crucial for developers in competitive markets, but existing methods often rely on post-release data due to challenges in pre-deployment prediction.

Method: The authors used 446 open-source Android apps from F-Droid, extracted code metrics, smells, metadata, and additional data from Google Play Store, and evaluated regression/classification models across three feature set types (Size-only, Handpicked, Voting).

Result: Regression models showed poor performance (low R²) due to data skew, but binary classification achieved significant results with the MLP model using the Voting set achieving F1-scores of 0.72.

Conclusion: Internal code metrics can serve as useful indicators for app popularity prediction, challenging prior dismissals of their predictive value for software quality.

Abstract: Predicting mobile app popularity before release can provide developers with a
strategic advantage in a competitive marketplace, yet it remains a challenging
problem. This study explores whether internal software metrics, measurable from
source code before deployment, can predict an app's popularity, defined by user
ratings (calculated from user reviews) and DownloadsPerYear (yearly downloads).
Using a dataset of 446 open-source Android apps from F-Droid, we extract a wide
array of features, including system-, class-, and method-level code metrics,
code smells, and app metadata. Additional information, such as user reviews,
download counts, and uses-permission, was collected from the Google Play Store.
We evaluate regression and classification models across three feature sets: a
minimal Size-only baseline, a domain-informed Handpicked set, and a Voting set
derived via feature selection algorithms. Regression models perform poorly due
to skewed data, with low $R^2$ scores. However, when reframed as binary
classification (Popular vs. Unpopular), results improve significantly. The best
model, a Multilayer Perceptron using the Voting set, achieves F1-scores of
0.72. These results suggest that internal code metrics, although limited in
their explanatory power, can serve as useful indicators of app popularity. This
challenges earlier findings that dismissed internal metrics as predictors of
software quality.

### [24] [A Multimodal Approach Combining Biometrics and Self-Report Instruments for Monitoring Stress in Programming: Methodological Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02118)
*Cristina Martinez Montes,Daniela Grassi,Nicole Novielli,Birgit Penzenstadle*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper compares psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators during software engineering tasks, finding no significant stress in psychometric instruments but notable EDA phasic peaks in biometrics, suggesting methodological limitations in stress induction through time pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-report instruments for assessing stress and well-being face concerns about potential biases, prompting exploration of objective physiological measures as alternatives for more reliable data.

Method: Participants completed pre-surveys, performed two programming tasks with biometric sensors, answered post-surveys, and underwent exit interviews, combining qualitative and physiological data collection.

Result: Psychometric stress measures showed no results; interviews revealed mixed perceptions (no stress but time pressure); biometric data showed significant differences solely in EDA phasic peaks.

Conclusion: The time limit-induced stress method proved insufficient, emphasizing the need for improved techniques in future studies combining psychometric and biometric approaches.

Abstract: The study of well-being, stress and other human factors has traditionally
relied on self-report instruments to assess key variables. However, concerns
about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and
standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these
measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures.
  We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators
and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software
engineering tasks.
  We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then
programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for
each, and finally went through a short exit interview.
  Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric
instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress
and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant
difference only in EDA phasic peaks.
  We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter
time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future
studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.

*Martin Obaidi,Marc Herrmann,Jil Klünder,Kurt Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates sentiment analysis tools across developer communication datasets from multiple platforms and proposes a method for selecting suitable tools based on dataset characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software development relies on text-based communication where sentiment analysis is critical, but tools struggle with cross-platform inconsistency due to varying communication styles and content.

Method: The study analyzes linguistic/statistical features of 10 datasets from 5 platforms, evaluates 14 sentiment analysis tools, and proposes a mapping approach with a questionnaire using dataset features to recommend tools.

Result: Dataset characteristics significantly influence tool selection (platforms differ in linguistic/statistical properties). Transformer-based models like SetFit/RoBERTa show consistent performance but context dependency remains.

Conclusion: The proposed approach helps select reliable sentiment analysis tools for software engineering contexts while emphasizing the need for continuous evaluation as communication norms evolve.

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on text-based communication, making
sentiment analysis a valuable tool for understanding team dynamics and
supporting trustworthy AI-driven analytics in requirements engineering.
However, existing sentiment analysis tools often perform inconsistently across
datasets from different platforms, due to variations in communication style and
content.
  In this study, we analyze linguistic and statistical features of 10 developer
communication datasets from five platforms and evaluate the performance of 14
sentiment analysis tools. Based on these results, we propose a mapping approach
and questionnaire that recommends suitable sentiment analysis tools for new
datasets, using their characteristic features as input.
  Our results show that dataset characteristics can be leveraged to improve
tool selection, as platforms differ substantially in both linguistic and
statistical properties. While transformer-based models such as SetFit and
RoBERTa consistently achieve strong results, tool effectiveness remains
context-dependent. Our approach supports researchers and practitioners in
selecting trustworthy tools for sentiment analysis in software engineering,
while highlighting the need for ongoing evaluation as communication contexts
evolve.

### [26] [Enhancing COBOL Code Explanations: A Multi-Agents Approach Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02182)
*Fangjian Lei,Jiawen Liu,Shayan Noei,Ying Zou,Derek Truong,William Alexander*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM approach improves COBOL code documentation by collaboratively explaining functions, files, and projects despite the language's complexity and token window limitations, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining COBOL systems is increasingly challenging due to aging codebases, lack of documentation, and declining developer expertise. Current LLM-based code explanation tools struggle with COBOL's architectural complexity and token window constraints, hindering their ability to document large-scale COBOL applications effectively.

Method: Proposed a collaborative framework where two LLM-based agents work together. They leverage contextual information from the codebase to construct optimized prompts for code explanation, enabling processing of COBOL elements beyond standard token window limits.

Result: Outperformed baselines with 12.67%+ METEOR, 18.59%+ chrF improvements in function explanations. Achieved 4.21%-14.68% gains in file-level metrics and successfully documented explanations for 82% of projects at the project level.

Conclusion: The multi-agent approach effectively addresses COBOL documentation challenges by combining contextual awareness and collaborative LLM prompting, significantly enhancing explanation quality across all code components while handling limitations imposed by the language's structure.

Abstract: Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to
develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business,
and government agencies. Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of
COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly
challenging. In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for
new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing
research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of
code snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its
architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed
the token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach
that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate
explanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents
incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into
the code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach
using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects. Our results indicate that our
approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code
explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR,
chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. At the file level, our approach
effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token
window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in
explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated
explanation. At the project level, our approach generates explanations that
convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.

*Chen Yang,Ziqi Wang,Yanjie Jiang,Lin Yang,Yuteng Zheng,Jianyi Zhou,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RTED is a new type-aware test generation technique that detects Python type errors more effectively than existing methods, reducing false positives and identifying previously unknown bugs in real-world projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python type errors often cause runtime failures, and current static analysis tools have high false positive rates. Unit test generation techniques need better guidance to find bugs.

Method: RTED combines step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to guide test generation and suppress false positives.

Result: RTED detected 22-29 more type errors than four state-of-the-art techniques on BugsInPy and TypeBugs benchmarks, achieved 173.9%-245.9% higher precision, and found 12 previously unknown type errors in open-source projects.

Conclusion: RTED significantly improves Python type error detection by addressing the limitations of existing static analysis and test generation approaches through its type-aware method.

Abstract: Type errors in Python often lead to runtime failures, posing significant
challenges to software reliability and developer productivity. Existing static
analysis tools aim to detect such errors without execution but frequently
suffer from high false positive rates. Recently, unit test generation
techniques offer great promise in achieving high test coverage, but they often
struggle to produce bug-revealing tests without tailored guidance. To address
these limitations, we present RTED, a novel type-aware test generation
technique for automatically detecting Python type errors. Specifically, RTED
combines step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to
guide the test generation process and effectively suppress false positives. We
evaluated RTED on two widely-used benchmarks, BugsInPy and TypeBugs.
Experimental results show that RTED can detect 22-29 more benchmarked type
errors than four state-of-the-art techniques. RTED is also capable of producing
fewer false positives, achieving an improvement of 173.9%-245.9% in precision.
Furthermore, RTED successfully discovered 12 previously unknown type errors
from six real-world open-source Python projects.

### [28] [VeFIA: An Efficient Inference Auditing Framework for Vertical Federated Collaborative Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02376)
*Chung-ju Huang,Ziqi Zhang,Yinggui Wang,Binghui Wang,Tao Wei,Leye Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VeFIA is a framework for auditing execution correctness of inference software in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) without compromising privacy or adding latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFL approaches lack mechanisms to verify data parties' inference software correctness, risking undetected execution errors/anomalies during collaborative computing.

Method: VeFIA leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and coordinator-assisted random sampling validation to enable task-party audits of data-party computations against expected results.

Result: VeFIA achieves 99.99% anomaly detection probability for >5.4% abnormal inferences while maintaining 100% positive/negative predictive value and true positive rates, with zero additional online inference latency.

Conclusion: VeFIA establishes the first execution correctness auditing methodology for VFL, demonstrating practical privacy-preserving verification with strong statistical guarantees.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment
mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

### [29] [Meta-Fair: AI-Assisted Fairness Testing of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02533)
*Miguel Romero-Arjona,José A. Parejo,Juan C. Alonso,Ana B. Sánchez,Aitor Arrieta,Sergio Segura*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Meta-Fair, an automated fairness testing framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages metamorphic testing and LLM self-evaluation to uncover bias without relying on manual resources or curated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM fairness testing methods are manual, resource-intensive, and limited by fixed templates/heuristics, making scalability and broad applicability challenging.

Method: Meta-Fair uses two core strategies: (1) metamorphic relations to systematically perturb input prompts and analyze output variation, and (2) LLMs themselves to generate test cases and classify outputs. It is supported by three open-source tools for automated testing workflows.

Result: Experiments on 12 pre-trained LLMs with 7.9K test cases showed Meta-Fair achieves 92% average precision and detects biased behavior in 29% of executions. LLM evaluators demonstrated F1-scores up to 0.79, though non-determinism reduced consistency.

Conclusion: Meta-Fair demonstrates that automated, LLM-driven testing can effectively uncover bias with minimal domain-specific resources. While challenges remain, this approach establishes a scalable framework for fairness assessment in LLMs.

Abstract: Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the
development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult
to assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language
models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic
heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult
to scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method
for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific
resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,
Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to
uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled
modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,
we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and
output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and
classify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source
tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test
cases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained
LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.
The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,
achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of
executions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,
with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although
non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through
careful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the
results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation
in LLM testing.

### [30] [LLMREI: Automating Requirements Elicitation Interviews with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02564)
*Alexander Korn,Samuel Gorsch,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMREI is a chat bot for automated requirements elicitation interviews evaluated in 33 simulations, showing comparable error rates to humans and effective requirement extraction without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Requirements elicitation interviews are resource-intensive, biased, and error-prone due to reliance on human analysts, necessitating automation to improve scalability and reduce common interview errors.

Method: The study developed LLMREI using zero-shot and least-to-most prompting techniques for automated requirements elicitation, assessed via simulated stakeholder interviews including contextual adaptation of questioning strategies.

Result: LLMREI demonstrated similar error rates to human interviewers (18% vs 23%), extracted ~87% of requirements in simulations, and generated context-dependent follow-up questions effectively without requiring stakeholder re-interview.

Conclusion: LLMREI presents a scalable solution for automated requirements elicitation particularly benefitting large stakeholder engagements, though maintains 80% human-level performance in error minimization with potential for further refinement.

Abstract: Requirements elicitation interviews are crucial for gathering system
requirements but heavily depend on skilled analysts, making them
resource-intensive, susceptible to human biases, and prone to miscommunication.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models present new opportunities for
automating parts of this process. This study introduces LLMREI, a chat bot
designed to conduct requirements elicitation interviews with minimal human
intervention, aiming to reduce common interviewer errors and improve the
scalability of requirements elicitation. We explored two main approaches,
zero-shot prompting and least-to-most prompting, to optimize LLMREI for
requirements elicitation and evaluated its performance in 33 simulated
stakeholder interviews. A third approach, fine-tuning, was initially considered
but abandoned due to poor performance in preliminary trials. Our study assesses
the chat bot's effectiveness in three key areas: minimizing common interview
errors, extracting relevant requirements, and adapting its questioning based on
interview context and user responses. Our findings indicate that LLMREI makes a
similar number of errors compared to human interviewers, is capable of
extracting a large portion of requirements, and demonstrates a notable ability
to generate highly context-dependent questions. We envision the greatest
benefit of LLMREI in automating interviews with a large number of stakeholders.

### [31] [Human-Machine Collaboration and Ethical Considerations in Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02578)
*Zoe Pfister*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in integrating Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) into adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), focusing on human-machine interaction principles, feedback loop adaptation (MAPE-K), and ethical frameworks for privacy and values throughout the system lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive CPS with HMT are challenging due to mismatched human-machine operational cadences in feedback loops and ethical concerns from monitoring human operators. Current methods lack integration of human values and privacy considerations into system design.

Method: The research develops novel methods: (1) Embedding HMT interaction principles into adaptive feedback loops (e.g., MAPE-K) to align human and machine operations, and (2) Creating lifecycle frameworks for ethics and human values integration, starting from requirements engineering.

Result: Proposed solutions include technical methods for HMT feedback integration and structured frameworks to ensure ethical compliance (privacy and human values) during CPS development and validation.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of aligning human-machine teamwork mechanisms with ethical considerations in CPS, proposing lifecycle approaches to close gaps in current adaptive systems research.

Abstract: Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that integrate both
physical and computational capabilities, which can adjust in response to
changing parameters. Furthermore, they increasingly incorporate human-machine
collaboration, allowing them to benefit from the individual strengths of humans
and machines. Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) represents the most advanced paradigm
of human-machine collaboration, envisioning seamless teamwork between humans
and machines. However, achieving effective and seamless HMT in adaptive CPS is
challenging. While adaptive CPS already benefit from feedback loops such as
MAPE-K, there is still a gap in integrating humans into these feedback loops
due to different operational cadences of humans and machines. Further, HMT
requires constant monitoring of human operators, collecting potentially
sensitive information about their actions and behavior. Respecting the privacy
and human values of the actors of the CPS is crucial for the success of
human-machine teams. This research addresses these challenges by: (1)
developing novel methods and processes for integrating HMT into adaptive CPS,
focusing on human-machine interaction principles and their incorporation into
adaptive feedback loops found in CPS, and (2) creating frameworks for
integrating, verifying, and validating ethics and human values throughout the
system lifecycle, starting from requirements engineering.

TL;DR: This paper investigates terminology divergences between Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and Software Engineering Researchers (SERs) to address communication challenges and foster collaboration through aligned concepts and a systematic mapping methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights communication inefficiencies caused by differing terminologies used by RSEs and SERs for similar software engineering concepts, motivating the need to align these understandings for improved interdisciplinary collaboration.

Method: The study systematically maps how software engineering fundamentals from the SER community are interpreted within the RSE community, identifying conceptual alignments, knowledge gaps, and potential adaptation opportunities through preliminary analysis.

Result: Preliminary findings reveal actionable opportunities for mutual learning between RSEs and SERs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for terminology mapping as a foundation for crowd-sourced validation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that addressing terminology differences between RSEs and SERs can enhance collaboration and knowledge-sharing, with the proposed methodology enabling future community-driven refinement and expansion of the conceptual alignment framework.

Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and
Software Engineering Researchers (SERs) often use different terminologies for
similar concepts, creating communication challenges. To better understand these
divergences, we have started investigating how SE fundamentals from the SER
community are interpreted within the RSE community, identifying aligned
concepts, knowledge gaps, and areas for potential adaptation. Our preliminary
findings reveal opportunities for mutual learning and collaboration, and our
systematic methodology for terminology mapping provides a foundation for a
crowd-sourced extension and validation in the future.

### [33] [RLHGNN: Reinforcement Learning-driven Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Next Activity Prediction in Business Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02690)
*Jiaxing Wang,Yifeng Yu,Jiahan Song,Bin Cao,Jing Fan,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RLHGNN is a reinforcement learning-based framework for next activity prediction in service-oriented architectures that addresses limitations of sequence/graph methods by dynamically constructing heterogeneous process graphs with tailored convolution strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six real-world datasets while maintaining 1ms inference latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequence-based methods fail to model non-sequential relationships (parallelism, conditional dependencies) in business processes, while graph-based approaches use homogeneous static structures that don't adapt to process complexity. Effective next activity prediction needs both structural preservation and dynamic adaptation for real-time applications.

Method: 1. Creates heterogeneous process graphs from event logs with three edge types (succession, choice, parallelism). 2. Generates four graph variations by combining edge types. 3. Uses reinforcement learning (Markov Decision Process) to select optimal graph structure for each process instance. 4. Applies heterogeneous graph convolution with relation-aware aggregation strategies.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across 6 datasets while maintaining ~1ms inference latency per prediction, demonstrating both accuracy superiority and practical real-time capabilities for business process monitoring.

Conclusion: RLHGNN provides an adaptive framework that effectively models both sequential and non-sequential relationships in service processes through heterogeneous graph representations and reinforcement learning optimization, offering a practical solution for dynamic business environments.

Abstract: Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The

*Sahar Ahmadisakha,Lech Bialek,Mohamed Soliman,Vasilios Andrikopoulos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces sustainability flags as pointers to identify sustainability in cloud architecture discussions, showing improved classification accuracy and usability compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to cloud computing necessitates informed architectural decisions regarding sustainability, but existing methods lack clear guidelines for recognizing these concepts in practitioner discussions.

Method: Sustainability flags were developed through thematic analysis of cloud providers' best practices and evaluated via a controlled experiment on cloud architecture posts.

Result: Flags classified fewer posts as sustainability-related than the control group, with moderately higher certainty, significantly improved performance, and perceived as more useful and understandable than definition-based methods.

Conclusion: Sustainability flags effectively identify sustainability in cloud architecture discussions, offering a practical alternative to traditional definitions and improving decision-making accuracy.

Abstract: In recent years, sustainability in software systems has gained significant
attention, especially with the rise of cloud computing and the shift towards
cloud-based architectures. This shift has intensified the need to identify
sustainability in architectural discussions to take informed architectural
decisions. One source to see these decisions is in online Q&A forums among
practitioners' discussions. However, recognizing sustainability concepts within
software practitioners' discussions remains challenging due to the lack of
clear and distinct guidelines for this task. To address this issue, we
introduce the notion of sustainability flags as pointers in relevant
discussions, developed through thematic analysis of multiple sustainability
best practices from cloud providers. This study further evaluates the
effectiveness of these flags in identifying sustainability within cloud
architecture posts, using a controlled experiment. Preliminary results suggest
that the use of flags results in classifying fewer posts as
sustainability-related compared to a control group, with moderately higher
certainty and significantly improved performance. Moreover, sustainability
flags are perceived as more useful and understandable than relying solely on
definitions for identifying sustainability.

### [35] [Legal Requirements Translation from Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02846)
*Anmol Singhal,Travis Breaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automated approach using textual entailment and in-context learning to generate a canonical representation of legal text as Python code, addressing limitations in existing methods by capturing interrelationships among metadata and reducing reliance on manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complying with legal regulations is resource-intensive for small organizations due to the complexity and length of legal texts. Prior automated extraction methods fail to model metadata interdependencies and lack generalization beyond labeled datasets.

Method: The authors introduce a method based on textual entailment and in-context learning to create a Python code representation of legal text. This uses a manually designed Python class metamodel that encodes structural and semantic metadata along with their interrelationships, avoiding the need for large manually labeled datasets.

Result: Evaluation on 13 U.S. state data breach notification laws shows the approach achieves 89.4% test case pass rates, with precision and recall of 82.2% and 88.7% respectively, demonstrating strong performance in capturing legal metadata relationships.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable solution for generating legal metadata by leveraging textual reasoning and domain-specific modeling, enabling effective compliance with minimal manual intervention while generalizing across new legal documents.

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

### [36] [Requirements Elicitation Follow-Up Question Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02858)
*Yuchen Shen,Anmol Singhal,Travis Breaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using GPT-4o to generate follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation, demonstrating that LLM-generated questions are at least as effective as human-authored ones when guided by a framework of common interviewer mistakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interviewers face challenges like domain unfamiliarity and cognitive overload in requirements elicitation interviews, prompting the need for real-time support tools. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest potential for enhancing this process via automated question generation.

Method: The authors developed a framework of common interviewer mistake types and conducted two controlled experiments to evaluate LLM-generated questions: (1) with minimal guidance and (2) guided by the framework. Human-authored questions were compared against LLM-generated ones for quality metrics.

Result: LLM-generated questions (with and without guidance) were equivalent to human-authored questions in clarity, relevancy, and informativeness. Guided LLM-generated questions outperformed human-authored questions, showing significant potential for mistake-mitigation in real-time interviews.

Conclusion: The study highlights the viability of LLMs (specifically GPT-4o) to assist interviewers by generating high-quality follow-up questions that reduce common errors and cognitive load, potentially improving the efficiency and effectiveness of requirements elicitation interviews.

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.
