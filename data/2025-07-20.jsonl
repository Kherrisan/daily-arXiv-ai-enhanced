We analyzed 183 research papers published between\nJanuary 2020 and December 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In\nRQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced\nLLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new\ndata sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks,\nhighlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across\nthese tasks.

A vanity address is\nan address that embeds custom characters such as a name. To generate a vanity\naddress, a classical try-and-error method is employed, and thus the number of\ncharacters to be embedded is limited. In this paper, we focus on the\nfunctionality of identity-based signatures (IBS) where any strings can be\nemployed as a verification key, and explore whether IBS can be used for\ngenerating a vanity address. We attach importance to the fact that it is not\nrealistic to replace ECDSA with key recovery, which is currently employed for\nissuing transactions in Ethereum, to an IBS scheme. Even if this replacement is\npossible, it is not a reasonable price for the ease of the vanity address\ngeneration. Thus, we pay attention to a generic construction of IBS from\nsignatures, and construct an IBS scheme from ECDSA with key recovery. Though we\ncannot directly generate a vanity address due to the key recovery functionality\nof the underlying ECDSA, we can connect any string with an address due to the\nfunctionality of IBS that can give additional meaning to the address. We\nimplement our system by Solidity, and demonstrate that the gas cost is almost\nsame as that of the ECDSA signature verification."}

However, these test cases often suffer from test\nsmells, quality issues such as ambiguity, redundancy, or missing checks that\nreduce test reliability and maintainability. While detection tools exist, they\ntypically require manual rule definition and lack scalability. This study\ninvestigates the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) for automatically\ndetecting test smells. We evaluate Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4 on 143\nreal-world Ubuntu test cases, covering seven types of test smells. Phi-4\nachieved the best results, reaching a pass@2 of 97% in detecting sentences with\ntest smells, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 reached approximately 91%. Beyond\ndetection, SLMs autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements, even\nwithout explicit prompt instructions. They enabled low-cost, concept-driven\nidentification of diverse test smells without relying on extensive rule\ndefinitions or syntactic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of\nSLMs as efficient tools that preserve data privacy and can improve test quality\nin real-world scenarios."}

It involves\ncollaboration among stakeholders to extract explicit requirements and address\npotential conflicts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently,\nmulti-agent systems for software development have attracted much attention.\nHowever, existing research provides limited support for requirements\ndevelopment and overlooks the injection of human knowledge into agents and the\nhuman-agent collaboration. % To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nknowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development,\nnamed iReDev. iReDev features: iReDev consists of six knowledge-driven agents\nto support the entire requirements development. They collaboratively perform\nvarious tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses\non integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world\nstakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an\nartifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger\nthe next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new\nrequirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to\nsupport human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align\nwith the expectations of stakeholders. We evaluated the generated artifacts and\nresults show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in multiple aspects. We\nfurther envision three key directions and hope this work can facilitate the\ndevelopment of intelligent requirements development."}

The trend is\nexpected to continue in the foreseeable future. Unlike traditional software\nsystems governed by deterministic logic, systems powered by pretrained models\nexhibit distinctive and emergent characteristics, such as ambiguous capability\nboundaries, context-dependent behavior, and continuous evolution. These\nproperties fundamentally challenge long-standing assumptions in requirements\nengineering, including functional decomposability and behavioral\npredictability. This paper investigates this problem and advocates for a\nrethinking of existing requirements engineering methodologies. We propose a\nconceptual framework tailored to requirements engineering of\npretrained-model-enabled software systems and outline several promising\nresearch directions within this framework. This vision helps provide a guide\nfor researchers and practitioners to tackle the emerging challenges in\nrequirements engineering of pretrained-model-enabled systems."}

While grammar mining techniques have focused on recovering\nsyntactic structures, the semantics of input processing remains largely\nunexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for inferring\nattributed grammars from parser implementations. Given an input grammar, our\ntechnique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers\nto reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in\nspecifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program\nexecutions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we\nsystematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This\nenables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of\nour approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately\nreproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars."}

However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises\nseveral new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code\nprovenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly\nconcerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its\ncompliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the\nother hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to\nmanual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments.\nAlthough some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods\nfor detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness\nwhen facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective\nsolution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may\nundergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of\nCodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against\ninput perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation\nmodule, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which\nsystematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial\nsamples. This module effectively enhances the model's resistance against\ndiverse adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the HMCorp dataset\ndemonstrate that CodeGPTSensor+ significantly improves detection accuracy on\nthe adversarial test set while maintaining high accuracy on the original test\nset, showcasing superior robustness compared to CodeGPTSensor."}
