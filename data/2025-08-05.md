### [1] [Quantum-Resistant RSA Modulus Decomposition via Adaptive Rényi Entropy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00840)
*Ruopengyu Xu,Chenglian Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a new RSA variant with quantum resistance by optimizing prime selection through Rényi entropy minimization, introducing a number-theoretic framework, an adaptive prime generation algorithm, and a security reduction proof equivalent to lattice-based schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address RSA's vulnerability to Shor's algorithm, the paper proposes improving quantum resistance by altering prime selection constraints, thereby exponentially increasing attack complexity while maintaining classical security assumptions.

Method: 1. Quantum-number theoretic security model linking prime distribution asymmetry to quantum attack complexity. 2. Adaptive prime generation algorithm producing R	extbackslash{é}nyi entropy-optimized moduli (Theorem 3.1). 3. Security reduction proof under quantum random oracle model (Theorem 5.3). Revised with lattice embedding constructions for Ring-LWE reductions and information-theoretic security bounds.

Result: The construction achieves $	extOmega(2^{k/3})$ quantum attack complexity for $k$-bit moduli, with prime existence proof for $	extgamma < 2^{-k/6}$ and computational equivalence to lattice-based schemes (Theorem 6.3). Classical RSA security assumptions remain applicable.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances RSA's quantum resilience via Rényi entropy optimization and number-theoretic innovations, maintaining classical security while matching lattice-based schemes' resistance under quantum conditions through three pivotal methodological advancements.

Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for enhancing RSA's
quantum resistance through adaptive R\'enyi entropy optimization in modulus
decomposition. We introduce a novel number-theoretic framework that
fundamentally alters RSA's vulnerability landscape against Shor's algorithm by
strategically constraining prime selection to minimize R\'enyi entropy
$\mathscr{H}_2$. Our approach features three fundamental innovations: (1) a
quantum-number theoretic security model establishing an exponential
relationship between prime distribution asymmetry and quantum attack
complexity, (2) an adaptive prime generation algorithm producing
$\mathscr{H}_2$-optimized moduli with provable security guarantees, and (3) a
security reduction proof demonstrating computational equivalence to
lattice-based schemes under quantum random oracle model. Theoretical analysis
proves our construction achieves $\Omega(2^{k/3})$ quantum attack complexity
for $k$-bit moduli while maintaining classical security assumptions equivalent
to standard RSA.
  \textbf{Key Enhancements in Revision:}
  (1) Prime existence proof for critical parameter $\gamma < 2^{-k/6}$ via
Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem (Theorem 3.1),
  (2) Explicit lattice embedding construction for Ring-LWE reduction (Theorem
5.3),
  (3) Quantum Fano bound for information-theoretic security (Theorem 6.3).

### [2] [eBPF-Based Real-Time DDoS Mitigation for IoT Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00851)
*Abdurrahman Tolay*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an IoT security framework using eBPF and XDP for in-kernel DDoS mitigation, demonstrating 97% effectiveness on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IoT security solutions are resource-intensive and unsuitable for constrained edge devices, necessitating lightweight, high-performance alternatives.

Method: The framework utilizes eBPF/XDP for kernel-level traffic analysis with a rate-based detection algorithm, evaluated via Docker simulations and Raspberry Pi 4 deployment.

Result: Achieved >97% mitigation against 100Mbps DDoS floods, preserved legitimate traffic and system stability in real-world testing.

Conclusion: eBPF/XDP provides an efficient, viable solution for securing IoT edge devices against volumetric network attacks with minimal resource overhead.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has intensified security
challenges, notably from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks launched
by compromised, resource-constrained devices. Traditional defenses are often
ill-suited for the IoT paradigm, creating a need for lightweight,
high-performance, edge-based solutions. This paper presents the design,
implementation, and evaluation of an IoT security framework that leverages the
extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and the eXpress Data Path (XDP) for
in-kernel mitigation of DDoS attacks. The system uses a rate-based detection
algorithm to identify and block malicious traffic at the earliest stage of the
network stack. The framework is evaluated using both Docker-based simulations
and real-world deployment on a Raspberry Pi 4, showing over 97% mitigation
effectiveness under a 100 Mbps flood. Legitimate traffic remains unaffected,
and system stability is preserved even under attack. These results confirm that
eBPF/XDP provides a viable and highly efficient solution for hardening IoT edge
devices against volumetric network attacks.

### [3] [Implementasi dan Pengujian Polimorfisme pada Malware Menggunakan Dasar Payload Metasploit Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00874)
*Luqman Muhammad Zagi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper discusses polymorphic malware techniques (dead code insertion, register substitution, instruction replacement) and evaluates detection methods including CTPH hashing and antivirus behavior-based analysis, finding instruction replacement most effective comparatively while traditional virus scanners struggle with mixed techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of detecting increasingly sophisticated polymorphic malware that automatically changes code patterns to evade traditional signature-based detection methods, which struggle since 1990 with this dynamic threat.

Method: The paper implemented obfuscation techniques through Ghost Writing Assembly in Metasploit Framework, then tested detection effectiveness using VirusTotal notifications (VT-notify), Context Triggered Piecewise Hash (CTPH), and direct scanning with selected antivirus programs.

Result: Polymorphic malware samples were undetected by VT-notify. CTPH achieved 52.3125% detection with combined techniques, while instruction replacement showed highest comparative effectiveness (0.0256). Behavioral-based antivirus solutions demonstrated varying potential against these polymorphic attacks.

Conclusion: Despite two decades of research, polymorphic malware remains challenging to detect. The study confirms that CTPH and behavioral analysis provide better detection capabilities than basic scanning methods, but highlights the need for further advancements in automated polymorphism detection strategies.

Abstract: Malware change day by day and become sophisticated. Not only the complexity
of the algorithm that generating malware, but also the camouflage methods.
Camouflage, formerly, only need a simple encryption. Now, camouflage are able
to change the pattern of code automatically. This term called Polymorphism.
This property is usually used to create a metamorphic and a polymorphic
malware. Although it has been around since 1990 still quite tricky to detect.
In general, there are three obfuscation techniques to create the nature of
polymorphism. That techniques are dead code insertion, register substitution,
and instruction replacement. This technique can be added to the Metasploit
Framework via Ghost Writing Assembly to get ASM files. The detection methods
that be used are VT-notify, Context Triggered Piecewise Hash (CTPH), and direct
scanning with an antivirus that has been selected. VTnotify show nothing wrong
with the files. The best CTPH value is generated by a mixture of technique
(average: 52.3125%), while if it is compared to the number of changes made,
instruction replacement have the best comparative value (0.0256). The result of
using antivirus scanning produces a variety of different results. Antivirus
with behavioural-based detection has a possibility to detect this polymorphism.

### [4] [Cyber-Zero: Training Cybersecurity Agents without Runtime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00910)
*Terry Yue Zhuo,Dingmin Wang,Hantian Ding,Varun Kumar,Zijian Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Cyber-Zero is a runtime-free framework for training cybersecurity LLMs using CTF writeups and persona-driven simulation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 13.1% gains over baselines on major CTF benchmarks without relying on executable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM training for cybersecurity relies on runtime environments, which are often inaccessible or unstable in this domain. Existing methods fail to leverage ephemeral challenge configurations, limiting agent development.

Method: Cyber-Zero reverse-engineers runtime behaviors by analyzing public CTF writeups and simulating realistic interaction sequences through persona-driven LLMs, enabling trajectory synthesis in runtime-free scenarios.

Result: Agents trained with Cyber-Zero show up to 13.1% absolute improvement on InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. The Cyber-Zero-32B model outperforms other open-weight systems and matches closed-source models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet.

Conclusion: Runtime-free trajectory synthesis with Cyber-Zero demonstrates a viable path to democratize cybersecurity agent development, balancing high performance (SOTA on open models) with lower resource requirements compared to environment-dependent approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software
engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments,
particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are
often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge
configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present
Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality
agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly
available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to
reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon
interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories
synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1%
absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF
benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model,
Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight
models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324
and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and
demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively
democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

### [5] [How Cybersecurity Behaviors affect the Success of Darknet Drug Vendors: A Quantitative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00934)
*Syon Balakrishnan,Aaron Grinberg*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study identifies product diversification as the key predictor of success for darknet drug vendors, with cybersecurity signaling (PGP encryption) primarily serving as a professional marker. Effective enforcement requires targeting diversified vendors through coordinated multi-category strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding vendor success factors in darknet markets is essential for developing enforcement strategies and analyzing evolving digital commerce dynamics.

Method: Quantitative nested regression analysis using 50,000+ listings from 2,653 Agora vendors (2014-2015), controlling for reputation, pricing, and category-specific variables to examine cybersecurity signaling and product diversification.

Result: Product diversification significantly increases vendor scale (169% higher odds per category), while PGP encryption acts as a professional credibility signal rather than independently driving success. Market dynamics show diversified vendors adapt better through portfolio breadth.

Conclusion: Differential category enforcement impacts market structure differently, and successful vendors function as adaptable enterprises. Countermeasures should prioritize multi-category targeting of diversified operations over traditional substance-specific approaches.

Abstract: Understanding behavioral drivers of success in illicit digital marketplaces
is critical for developing effective enforcement strategies and understanding
digital commerce evolution, as darknet drug markets represent a growing share
of the total drug economy. This study employs quantitative regression analysis
of 50,000+ listings from 2,653 vendors in the Agora marketplace (2014-2015),
examining relationships between cybersecurity signaling (PGP encryption
mentions), product diversification, and commercial success through nested
regression specifications controlling for reputation, pricing, and
category-specific factors. Product diversification emerges as the dominant
predictor of vendor scale, increasing the odds of large vendor status by 169%
per additional category, while PGP encryption signaling functions primarily as
a professional marker rather than an independent success factor. Vendor success
depends on portfolio breadth rather than specialization, with category-specific
enforcement creating differential market constraints. Successful vendors
operate as diversified enterprises capable of rapid pivoting between product
categories, requiring targeted enforcement towards diversified vendors based on
coordinated multi-category enforcement approaches rather than traditional
substance-specific targeting strategies.

### [6] [Measuring Harmfulness of Computer-Using Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00935)
*Aaron Xuxiang Tian,Ruofan Zhang,Janet Tang,Jiaxin Wen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CUAHarm, a benchmark evaluating computer-using agents (CUAs) for misuse risks via realistic malicious tasks (e.g., firewall disable, data leaks), revealing high compliance rates across frontier LMs and agentic frameworks, and highlights limited effectiveness of monitoring strategies for CUAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately assess safety risks of CUAs with unrestricted computer access. Traditional focus on chatbots/tool-usage lacks realism for worst-case scenarios like system-level attacks.

Method: Created CUAHarm with 104 expert-designed misuse tasks using sandboxed environments and verifiable outcome tracking. Tested open-source/proprietary LMs (Claude 3.x, GPT-4o, Llama-3.3-70B, Mistral Large 2) and agentic framework UI-TARS-1.5 through both malicious instructions and benign variants to isolate refusal behavior. Evaluated monitoring approaches (CoT analysis, hierarchical summarization) for mitigation.

Result: 59% task success rate for Claude 3.7 Sonnet in executing malicious tasks without jailbreaking. Newer models show 15% higher misuse rates than predecessors. Agentic framework increases performance by 37% but raises misuse success rates by 48%. CoT monitoring only reaches 72% accuracy, with hierarchical summarization adding minimal improvement (<4%). Models demonstrate willingness to execute harmful actions in sandboxed environments.

Conclusion: CUAs represent a distinct and severe safety risk class compared to chatbots. Current alignment defenses fail under realistic computer access scenarios. Mitigation through output monitoring is significantly less effective than in chat interfaces. Open-sourcing CUAHarm provides a critical infrastructure to study and improve CUA safety. Future work should focus on robust monitoring mechanisms beyond simple CoT analysis.

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs), which autonomously control computers to perform
multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. Existing
benchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or
simple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better
evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm
consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling
firewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service
attacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and
rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these
tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We
evaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude
Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.
Surprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these
frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate
(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:
Claude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these
models are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in
chatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading
agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it
also amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from
alignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to
monitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is
significantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,
with average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical
summarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at
https://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm.

### [7] [LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00943)
*Chloe Li,Mary Phuong,Noah Y. Siegel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the vulnerability of chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring to covert sandbagging by AI models. Both frontier and small models can evade monitoring 16-36% of the time when aware of the detector, and the study reveals attack surfaces while generating five covert sandbagging strategies to aid future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring trustworthy AI evaluation is critical for safety, and CoT monitoring is a promising defense against sandbagging. Understanding its limitations helps strengthen safety protocols and improve monitoring techniques for dangerous capabilities.

Method: Researchers tested models' ability to sandbag under two scenarios: (1) monitor-oblivious prompting and (2) monitor-aware prompting. Success rates in bypassing the monitor were measured quantitatively, and qualitative analysis was performed on uncaught chain-of-thoughts to identify evasion patterns.

Result: Models exhibit 0-shot covert sandbagging capability against existing CoT monitoring systems but fail to bypass the monitor reliably (16-36% success rate when aware). Qualitative analysis revealed novel attack patterns, and five effective sandbagging policies were generated and validated.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate CoT monitoring's potential but highlight its current limitations. The identified attack surfaces and generated policies provide valuable resources for studying sandbagging behaviors and improving monitoring robustness for safer AI deployment.

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial
for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically
demonstrated threat to this is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on
evaluations by AI models or their developers. One promising defense is to
monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its
intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag
on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to
sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that
both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against
CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably:
they bypass the monitor 16-36\% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on
sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to
understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT
monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models.
These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help
build more diverse sandbagging model organisms.

### [8] [Autonomous Penetration Testing: Solving Capture-the-Flag Challenges with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01054)
*Isabelle Bakker,John Hastings*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study assesses GPT-4o's autonomous capabilities in solving beginner offensive security tasks via OverTheWire's Bandit CTF, achieving an 80% success rate with notable strengths in single-step challenges and weaknesses in multi-step, complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research explores how LLMs might automate penetration-testing workflows for novices, potentially enabling or impairing cybersecurity practice, while identifying architectural limitations that affect system interactivity.

Method: 25 Bandit levels were tested using a single-command SSH framework with GPT-4o solving tasks either unaided or with minimal hinting, tracking both success rates and execution patterns.

Result: GPT-4o solved 18/25 levels unaided and 2/5 with hints (80% total), excelling in Linux navigation and data decoding but failing multi-command tasks requiring persistent environment navigation or specialized shell interactions.

Conclusion: LLMs show substantial automation potential for novice penetration testing, offering productivity benefits for defenders while highlighting architectural gaps. Results also suggest educational applications and indicate secure-by-design environments could counter simple LLM-based attacks.

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of GPT-4o to autonomously solve
beginner-level offensive security tasks by connecting the model to
OverTheWire's Bandit capture-the-flag game. Of the 25 levels that were
technically compatible with a single-command SSH framework, GPT-4o solved 18
unaided and another two after minimal prompt hints for an overall 80% success
rate. The model excelled at single-step challenges that involved Linux
filesystem navigation, data extraction or decoding, and straightforward
networking. The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at
a human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that
required persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon
creation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight
current architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit
knowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can
automate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow,
potentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering
productivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides.
Further, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design
environments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future
hardening strategies. Beyond offensive cybersecurity applications, results
suggest the potential to integrate LLMs into cybersecurity education as
practice aids.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct is a cybersecurity-optimized LLM designed for chat and instruction-following, outperforming Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct and matching GPT-4o-mini on domain-specific tasks. Released publicly for professional use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of general LLMs in cybersecurity due to data scarcity, technical complexities, and safety/regex concerns by creating a specialized, interactive model for professional workflows.

Method: Extended Foundation-Sec-8B through instruction-following training, conversational modeling, and human preference alignment to enable dialogue-based interactions while preserving cybersecurity expertise.

Result: Outperformed Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct on cybersecurity tasks and demonstrated equivalent performance to GPT-4o-mini in threat intelligence and instruction-following benchmarks.

Conclusion: The model provides practical, high-quality cyber dialogue assistance for professionals through its dual focus on domain knowledge and conversational capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success across many
domains, yet their integration into cybersecurity applications remains limited
due to a lack of general-purpose cybersecurity data, representational
complexity, and safety and regulatory concerns. To address this gap, we
previously introduced Foundation-Sec-8B, a cybersecurity-focused LLM suitable
for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. That model, however, was not designed for
chat-style interactions or instruction-following. In this report, we release
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct: a model specifically trained for general-purpose
cybersecurity dialogue. Built on Foundation-Sec-8B, it combines domain-specific
knowledge with instruction-following, conversational capabilities, and
alignment with human preferences to produce high-quality, relevant responses.
Comprehensive evaluations show that Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct outperforms
Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct on a range of cybersecurity tasks while matching its
instruction-following performance. It is also competitive with GPT-4o-mini on
cyber threat intelligence and instruction-following tasks. We envision
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct becoming an indispensable assistant in the daily
workflows of cybersecurity professionals. We release the model publicly at
https://huggingface.co/fdtn-ai/Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct.

### [10] [CP-FREEZER: Latency Attacks against Vehicular Cooperative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01062)
*Chenyi Wang,Ruoyu Song,Raymond Muller,Jean-Philippe Monteuuis,Z. Berkay Celik,Jonathan Petit,Ryan Gerdes,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces CP-FREEZER, a novel latency attack on cooperative perception systems for autonomous vehicles, which exploits V2V messages with adversarial perturbations to increase end-to-end processing latency by over 90× in real-world tests. The attack highlights significant safety risks due to disrupted timeliness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although adversarial integrity attacks on cooperative perception (CP) systems are studied, safety-critical timeliness/availability vulnerabilities remain underexplored. Autonomous driving requires real-time situational awareness, making latency attacks a dangerous yet unstudied threat vector.

Method: CP-FREEZER addresses three challenges: non-differentiable point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous knowledge of victims' inputs due to transmission delays, and execution time maximization. The attack uses a tailored loss function during training to craft adversarial inputs that trigger computation-expensive operations in CP algorithms through manipulated V2V messages.

Result: Experiments on a real-world vehicle testbed achieved 90+× latency amplification (100% success rate), pushing processing times beyond 3 seconds for individual frames while maintaining undetectable perturbation magnitudes.

Conclusion: CP-FREEZER demonstrates a critical timeliness vulnerability in CP systems, proving adversarial latency attacks can destabilize autonomous driving. The results emphasize urgent development of robust defenses against data-driven computation delay attacks in vehicular networks.

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and
autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents.
While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade
perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on
timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous
driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that
maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial
perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges,
including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous
knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel
loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline.
Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by
over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100%
success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical
threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for
robust defenses.

### [11] [Provably Secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01084)
*Pengcheng Zhou,Yinglun Feng,Zhongliang Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAG, the first provably secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that employs pre-storage full-encryption to protect both retrieved content and vector embeddings, with formal security proofs and experimental validation against advanced attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems face unaddressed privacy/security risks (data leakage, poisoning) where defense strategies rely on heuristic filtering or retriever robustness, lacking interpretability, formal guarantees, and resistance to adaptive attacks.

Method: SAG implements pre-storage full-encryption for dual protection of data and vector embeddings, utilizes computational security models for formal confidentiality/integrity proofs, and validates security through experiments.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks show SAG effectively resists state-of-the-art attacks. Formal proofs confirm the encryption scheme satisfies confidentiality and integrity requirements.

Conclusion: SAG establishes a theoretical foundation and practical paradigm for verifiably secure RAG systems, enabling AI services with formal security guarantees while maintaining functionality.

Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been widely
applied, the privacy and security risks they face, such as data leakage and
data poisoning, have not been systematically addressed yet. Existing defense
strategies primarily rely on heuristic filtering or enhancing retriever
robustness, which suffer from limited interpretability, lack of formal security
guarantees, and vulnerability to adaptive attacks. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the first provably secure framework for RAG systems(SAG).
Our framework employs a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to ensure dual
protection of both retrieved content and vector embeddings, guaranteeing that
only authorized entities can access the data. Through formal security proofs,
we rigorously verify the scheme's confidentiality and integrity under a
computational security model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively resists a range of
state-of-the-art attacks. This work establishes a theoretical foundation and
practical paradigm for verifiably secure RAG systems, advancing AI-powered
services toward formally guaranteed security.

### [12] [An Unconditionally Secure Encryption Scheme for IoBT Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01085)
*Mohammad Moltafet,Hamid R. Sadjadpour,Zouheir Rezki*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents an unconditionally secure encryption scheme for IoBT systems, ensuring semantic security even against adversaries with unlimited computational power, using a combination of shared random binary matrices and pre-established pairwise keys via finite group modular addition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Devices in IoBT systems require secure communication during missions despite adversaries with unbounded computational power having full access to encrypted messages without tampering.

Method: An encryption scheme leveraging finite group modular addition, a securely shared random binary matrix, and pre-established pairwise random keys between devices to enable message encryption.

Result: The scheme demonstrates absolute semantic security (even a computationally unlimited adversary cannot infer message bits except with exponentially small probability) and computational security against key recovery attacks when the matrix is exposed.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme guarantees robust security under strict adversarial conditions, including computational security if the random matrix’s secrecy is compromised.

Abstract: We consider an Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system consisting of
multiple devices that want to securely communicate with each other during a
mission in the presence of an adversary with unbounded computational power. The
adversary has complete access to listen/read the ciphertext without tampering
with the communication line. We provide an unconditionally secure encryption
scheme to exchange messages among devices in the system. The main idea behind
the scheme is to provide secret keys to exchange messages using a random binary
matrix that is securely shared among all the devices, and pair-wise random
secret keys established between each pair of devices attempting to communicate
before the mission. The scheme is implemented by using finite group modular
addition. We show that the scheme is absolutely semantically secure, i.e., the
scheme guarantees that an adversary with unbounded computational power cannot
get even one bit of information about a message, except for an exponentially
small probability in a security parameter. Besides that, we show that even if
the random binary matrix is revealed to the adversary, the provided scheme is
computationally secure against the key recovery attack.

### [13] [AdVAR-DNN: Adversarial Misclassification Attack on Collaborative DNN Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01107)
*Shima Yousefi,Motahare Mounesan,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AdVAR-DNN is a black-box misclassification attack exploiting insecure communication in collaborative DNN inference, effectively hiding in the information exchange without needing model details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on collaborative DNN inference in IoT environments requires secure exchange of dynamic partitioning information. Current practices expose privacy vulnerabilities during model information sharing, potentially compromising sensitive data in unsecured networks/relays.

Method: The attack combines: (1) a VAE to generate undetectable manipulated samples, and (2) a classifier to detect model partitioning information. It operates in a black-box scenario—no prior model architecture or partitioning knowledge is needed—leveraging the inherent vulnerabilities of insecure information flows between collaborators.

Result: Evaluations on popular classification DNNs using CIFAR-100 dataset show AdVAR-DNN achieves high attack success rates with minimal detection likelihood, demonstrating both effectiveness and stealth in compromising collaborative inference.

Conclusion: AdVAR-DNN exposes critical security risks in collaborative DNN inference by exploiting information exchange vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for robust security protocols to prevent such undetectable black-box attacks in IoT environments.

Abstract: In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become increasingly
integral to IoT-based environments, enabling realtime visual computing.
However, the limited computational capacity of these devices has motivated the
adoption of collaborative DNN inference, where the IoT device offloads part of
the inference-related computation to a remote server. Such offloading often
requires dynamic DNN partitioning information to be exchanged among the
participants over an unsecured network or via relays/hops, leading to novel
privacy vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose AdVAR-DNN, an adversarial
variational autoencoder (VAE)-based misclassification attack, leveraging
classifiers to detect model information and a VAE to generate untraceable
manipulated samples, specifically designed to compromise the collaborative
inference process. AdVAR-DNN attack uses the sensitive information exchange
vulnerability of collaborative DNN inference and is black-box in nature in
terms of having no prior knowledge about the DNN model and how it is
partitioned. Our evaluation using the most popular object classification DNNs
on the CIFAR-100 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of AdVAR-DNN in terms
of high attack success rate with little to no probability of detection.

### [14] [Beyond Algorithmic Proofs: Towards Implementation-Level Provable Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01144)
*Jiahui Shang,Luning Zhang,Zhongxiang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Presents Implementation-Level Provable Security, a new paradigm for modeling system-layer security, demonstrated through SEER - a file destruction system with verified resilience against real-world attacks. Achieves irrecoverability guarantees with practical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cryptographic security focuses on algorithms but real attacks exploit implementation flaws (memory management, entropy, key lifecycle). Existing approaches lack a unified framework for implementation-layer security.

Method: Proposes a structural verification approach to model attack surfaces during deployment. Creates SEER by repurposing Babuk ransomware's encryption core with three key features: 1) key erasure, 2) entropy validation, 3) execution consistency checks.

Result: SEER achieves strong data irrecoverability guarantees while maintaining practical performance. Evaluation shows the system reduces attack surfaces through formal constraints and auditability without compromising effectiveness.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of shifting from abstract theoretical security models to practically verifiable implementation-layer security. Provides a framework for addressing system-level vulnerabilities holistically.

Abstract: While traditional cryptographic research focuses on algorithm-level provable
security, many real-world attacks exploit weaknesses in system implementations,
such as memory mismanagement, poor entropy sources, and insecure key
lifecycles. Existing approaches address these risks in isolation but lack a
unified, verifiable framework for modeling implementation-layer security. In
this work, we propose Implementation-Level Provable Security, a new paradigm
that defines security in terms of structurally verifiable resilience against
real-world attack surfaces during deployment. To demonstrate its feasibility,
we present SEER (Secure and Efficient Encryption-based Erasure via Ransomware),
a file destruction system that repurposes and reinforces the encryption core of
Babuk ransomware. SEER incorporates key erasure, entropy validation, and
execution consistency checks to ensure a well-constrained, auditable attack
surface. Our evaluation shows that SEER achieves strong irrecoverability
guarantees while maintaining practical performance. This work demonstrates a
shift from abstract theoretical models toward practically verifiable
implementation-layer security.

### [16] [AgentArmor: Enforcing Program Analysis on Agent Runtime Trace to Defend Against Prompt Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01249)
*Peiran Wang,Yang Liu,Yunfei Lu,Yifeng Cai,Hongbo Chen,Qingyou Yang,Jie Zhang,Jue Hong,Ye Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AgentArmor is a program analysis framework that treats LLM agent runtime traces as structured programs, enabling security policy enforcement through static type checking and achieving high detection accuracy for prompt injection vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents introduce security risks via dynamic, non-transparent behavior and prompt injection attacks, necessitating program analysis techniques to detect policy violations and enforce security.

Method: AgentArmor uses three components: (1) graph constructor to convert agent traces into CFG/DFG/PDG structures, (2) property registry to annotate tool/data metadata, and (3) type system for static inference/checking over the intermediate representation.

Result: Evaluations on AgentDojo benchmark demonstrate 95.75% true positive rate (TPR) and 3.66% false positive rate (FPR) in detecting prompt injection vulnerabilities while enforcing security policies.

Conclusion: Structured program analysis of LLM agent traces via AgentArmor enables robust detection of prompt injection attacks and effective enforcement of fine-grained security policies with strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving
various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of
external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces
critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection
attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime
traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present
AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph
intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations
(e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system.
AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that
reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate
representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a
property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools
& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over
the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured
programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust
boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo
benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with
only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect
prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

### [17] [Defending Against Beta Poisoning Attacks in Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01276)
*Nilufer Gulciftci,M. Emre Gursoy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes four defenses (KPB, NCC, CBD, MDT) against Beta Poisoning attacks, which introduce non-separability in datasets. KPB and MDT achieve perfect accuracy/F1 scores on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, while CBD and NCC also show strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beta Poisoning attacks disrupt ML model accuracy by making datasets linearly non-separable, posing a critical threat to ML security. Effective defenses are needed to preserve model performance under such adversarial manipulation.

Method: Based on observations of Beta Poisoning sample characteristics (e.g., proximity to each other and target class mean), four defenses were designed: (1) kNN proximity-based filtering, (2) neighborhood class comparison, (3) clustering-based isolation, and (4) mean distance thresholding. Each method exploits spatial relationships between samples and class distributions.

Result: The proposed defenses achieved: (1) KPB and MDT reached 100% accuracy and F1 scores on MNIST/CIFAR-10, (2) CBD and NCC demonstrated strong, albeit slightly lower, defensive performance. Parameter analysis revealed practical insights into how these defenses behave under different attack conditions.

Conclusion: KPB and MDT effectively neutralize Beta Poisoning attacks while maintaining full accuracy on benchmark datasets. The study provides a robust defense framework against non-separability-based poisoning, with actionable insights for parameter tuning in real-world ML deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks, in which an attacker adversarially manipulates the
training dataset of a machine learning (ML) model, pose a significant threat to
ML security. Beta Poisoning is a recently proposed poisoning attack that
disrupts model accuracy by making the training dataset linearly nonseparable.
In this paper, we propose four defense strategies against Beta Poisoning
attacks: kNN Proximity-Based Defense (KPB), Neighborhood Class Comparison
(NCC), Clustering-Based Defense (CBD), and Mean Distance Threshold (MDT). The
defenses are based on our observations regarding the characteristics of
poisoning samples generated by Beta Poisoning, e.g., poisoning samples have
close proximity to one another, and they are centered near the mean of the
target class. Experimental evaluations using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that KPB and MDT can achieve perfect accuracy and F1 scores, while
CBD and NCC also provide strong defensive capabilities. Furthermore, by
analyzing performance across varying parameters, we offer practical insights
regarding defenses' behaviors under varying conditions.

*Wenwen Zhou,Dongyang Lyu,Xiaoqi Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes blockchain security threats from a cryptographic perspective, examines attacks across its six-layer architecture, and proposes mitigation strategies for common attack vectors like 51% attacks and reentrancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blockchain security is increasingly vital due to the technology’s growing adoption and sophisticated attacks. The paper addresses these threats to guide safe implementation and future development of blockchain systems.

Method: The study first explains cryptographic fundamentals (hash functions, digital signatures) in blockchain. It then categorizes attacks by the blockchain’s six architectural layers and analyzes six specific attack types with corresponding defense strategies.

Result: The analysis provides methods to mitigate data layer tampering, network layer disruptions (e.g., Sybil attacks), consensus layer vulnerabilities (e.g., 51% attacks), and application layer risks (e.g., reentrancy). Practical solutions for each attack type are proposed.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for robust cryptographic defenses at every blockchain layer and highlights future research directions to tackle emerging threats, ensuring the sustainable development of blockchain technology.

Abstract: As an emerging service framework built by combining cryptography, P2P
network, consensus mechanism and innovative contract technology, blockchain has
been widely used in digital finance, data sharing, message traceability and
electronic evidence preservation because of its decentralised, non-tamperable
and transaction traceability. However, with the complex and changeable
application scenarios of blockchain technology and the continuous enhancement
of blockchain attack technology, the security of the blockchain system has been
seriously threatened, dramatically affecting the development and application of
blockchain technology. This paper aims to analyse the attacks on blockchain
from the perspective of cryptography. Firstly, from the cryptography technology
in the blockchain, the principle of hash functions, digital signatures, and
other technologies, as well as their role in the blockchain, are introduced.
Then, based on the six-layer architecture of the blockchain, the attacks on the
data layer, the network layer, the consensus layer, the contract layer, the
incentive layer and the application layer are analysed, and the methods to
mitigate or resist the attacks are proposed. Secondly, the attack principles of
51% attack, Double-Spending attack, Reentrancy attack, Replay attack, Sybil
attack and Timestamp Tampering attack were analysed, and the mitigation or
defence solutions for these six attacks were designed. Finally, the core
problems to be solved in blockchain technology are summarised, and the future
development of blockchain security technology is projected.

*Zhenhua Zou,Zhuotao Liu,Lepeng Zhao,Qiuyang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BlockA2A is a unified trust framework for LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes) that addresses security vulnerabilities using decentralized identifiers (DIDs), blockchain-anchored ledgers, and smart contracts. It introduces a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) for real-time attack mitigation and demonstrates sub-second overhead in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy security strategies fail to address fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and risks from Byzantine agents/adversarial prompts in LLM-driven MASes, necessitating a unified solution for verifiable interoperability and accountability.

Method: 1) Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for cross-domain agent authentication. 2) Blockchain-anchored ledgers for immutable auditability. 3) Smart contracts for dynamic context-aware access control. 4) Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) with mechanisms like Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission revocation.

Result: Empirical evaluations show BlockA2A effectively neutralizes prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral, and systemic MAS attacks. Integration into Google's A2A protocol is formalized, with experiments confirming sub-second overhead for scalable deployment.

Conclusion: BlockA2A establishes a decentralized trust model for secure LLM MAS interactions while maintaining performance viability for production environments through its integrated security mechanisms and real-time defense orchestration.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is
transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex
workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven
multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure
communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or
adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of
these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies
cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the
first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable
and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts
decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent
authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability,
and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control
policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message
authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across
agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine
(DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including
Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission
revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in
neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS
attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a
practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that
BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment
in production LLM-based MAS environments.

### [20] [UEChecker: Detecting Unchecked External Call Vulnerabilities in DApps via Graph Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01343)
*Dechao Kong,Xiaoqi Li,Wenkai Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: UEChecker is a deep learning-based tool utilizing call graphs and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities in DApps, achieving 87.59% accuracy through modules for edge prediction, node aggregation, and Conformer Block integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the $66 billion economic losses caused by contract layer attacks in DApps, particularly due to unchecked external calls that enable exploits like flash loan and reentrancy attacks. Existing detection methods lack precision in identifying these vulnerabilities.

Method: UEChecker employs a call graph representation enhanced by three core modules: (1) Edge Prediction Module to reconstruct node/edge features, (2) Node Aggregation Module to capture local and global structural information through neighbor interactions, and (3) Conformer Block combining multi-head attention, convolution, and feedforward networks to model multi-scale dependencies. These are integrated with a GCN framework for vulnerability detection.

Result: Evaluation on 608 DApp smart contracts demonstrated 87.59% detection accuracy for unchecked external call vulnerabilities. Comparative analysis showed UEChecker outperformed baseline models (GAT, LSTM, GCN) in accuracy metrics across all experiments.

Conclusion: UEChecker provides an effective solution for detecting unchecked external call vulnerabilities through its novel combination of call graph analysis and deep learning modules. The framework consistently surpasses traditional GCN-based approaches, enabling robust detection of sophisticated financial exploits in blockchain environments.

Abstract: The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted
in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when
contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the
calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and
reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based
tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect
unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An
edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes
and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural
information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing
feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of
the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head
attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more
effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph,
extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of
vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph
Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By
auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool
achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN
baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently
outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.

### [21] [MultiCFV: Detecting Control Flow Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts Leveraging Multimodal Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01346)
*Hongli Peng,Xiaoqi Li,Wenkai Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiCFV, a multimodal deep learning method for detecting control flow vulnerabilities and code clones in smart contracts by fusing graph, syntax, and comment features, improving detection accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities causing asset losses, and existing tools using single-modality approaches (source code or bytecode) lack performance, accuracy, and generalization. There is a need for a more effective method to address these issues.

Method: MultiCFV combines three modalities: (1) control flow graphs from bytecode with graph embedding, (2) syntax features via abstract syntax trees, and (3) semantic features from code comments. These vectors are fused into an inspection database for vulnerability and clone detection.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that MultiCFV improves accuracy for both erroneous control flow vulnerability detection and code clone identification in smart contracts, outperforming single-modality approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating structural, syntactic, and semantic information through a multimodal framework enhances smart contract analysis, offering robust solutions for vulnerability detection and code similarity identification.

Abstract: The introduction of smart contract functionality marks the advent of the
blockchain 2.0 era, enabling blockchain technology to support digital currency
transactions and complex distributed applications. However, many smart
contracts have been found to contain vulnerabilities and errors, leading to the
loss of assets within the blockchain. Despite a range of tools that have been
developed to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts at the source code or
bytecode level, most rely on a single modality, reducing performance, accuracy,
and limited generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a multimodal deep
learning approach, MultiCFV, which is designed specifically to analyze and
detect erroneous control flow vulnerability, as well as identify code clones in
smart contracts. Bytecode is generated from source code to construct control
flow graphs, with graph embedding techniques extracting graph features.
Abstract syntax trees are used to obtain syntax features, while code comments
capture key commentary words and comment features. These three feature vectors
are fused to create a database for code inspection, which is used to detect
similar code and identify contract vulnerabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate our method effectively combines structural, syntactic, and semantic
information, improving the accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection
and clone detection.

*Yuanzheng Niu,Xiaoqi Li,Wenkai Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NATLM is a framework that combines static analysis and large language models (Gemini Pro 1.5) to detect four critical vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts, achieving high precision, recall, and F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite growing significance of NFTs as digital assets, undiscovered smart contract defects pose substantial financial risks. Current LLM-based methods for security analysis face high false-positive rates.

Method: Integrates static analysis (AST/CFG extraction, feature vector generation) with semantic LLM analysis. Combines code features with vectors of known defect examples to create a knowledge base matrix, then uses vector comparisons and deep LLM analysis for detection.

Result: Analyzed 8,672 NFT contracts with 87.72% precision, 89.58% recall, and 88.94% F1 score, outperforming baselines in detecting ERC-721 Reentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach of static analysis and LLMs significantly improves detection accuracy for NFT smart contract vulnerabilities compared to existing methods, offering a promising solution for blockchain security.

Abstract: Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid
evolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets,
they have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of
NFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to
substantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper
presents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect
potential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies
four common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721
Reentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying
exclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a
high false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates
static analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM
employs static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow
information from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and
Control Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with
vectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the
knowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the
analyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base.
Finally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection
capabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of
potential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed
8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%,
a recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other
baseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.

*Zihan Wang,Rui Zhang,Hongwei Li,Wenshu Fan,Wenbo Jiang,Qingchuan Zhao,Guowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes ConfGuard, a lightweight detection method for backdoor attacks in LLMs by monitoring sequence lock patterns in token confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses for LLM backdoors are ineffective due to the models' autoregressive nature and large output space, leading to poor performance and high latency.

Method: They identify 'sequence lock' phenomena (anomalously high confidence in target sequences of backdoored models) and propose a sliding window-based token confidence monitoring approach for lightweight detection.

Result: ConfGuard achieves near 100% true positive rate with negligible false positive rate and minimal/zero additional latency in most cases through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ConfGuard provides a practical real-time defense mechanism for LLMs against backdoor attacks without compromising model performance through its confidence-based detection methodology.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Large Language Models (LLMs),
where adversaries can embed hidden triggers to manipulate LLM's outputs. Most
existing defense methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, are
ineffective against the autoregressive nature and vast output space of LLMs,
thereby suffering from poor performance and high latency. To address these
limitations, we investigate the behavioral discrepancies between benign and
backdoored LLMs in output space. We identify a critical phenomenon which we
term sequence lock: a backdoored model generates the target sequence with
abnormally high and consistent confidence compared to benign generation.
Building on this insight, we propose ConfGuard, a lightweight and effective
detection method that monitors a sliding window of token confidences to
identify sequence lock. Extensive experiments demonstrate ConfGuard achieves a
near 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and a negligible false positive rate (FPR)
in the vast majority of cases. Crucially, the ConfGuard enables real-time
detection almost without additional latency, making it a practical backdoor
defense for real-world LLM deployments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs for automated smart contract exploit generation using ReX framework, finding 92% success rate with Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 as top performers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart contracts face increasing security challenges, and existing AEG methods lack effectiveness against complex vulnerabilities. This research explores LLMs' potential to enable reliable exploit generation for vulnerability identification and mitigation.

Method: The authors developed ReX, a framework combining LLM-based exploit synthesis with Foundry testing suite. They evaluated five state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4, DeepSeek, Qwen3 Plus) on synthetic benchmarks and real-world vulnerable contracts. They also analyzed model performance factors and created a curated dataset of real exploit examples.

Result: Modern LLMs achieved 92% success rate in generating functional PoC exploits across diverse vulnerabilities. Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 showed best performance in both synthetic (84-95%) and real-world (78-94%) scenarios. The study identified correlations between model capacity, contract structure, and exploit discovery effectiveness.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate strong potential for automated exploit generation against smart contracts. The ReX framework and new curated dataset provide valuable resources for advancing AEG research and improving smart contract security through automated vulnerability testing.

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using LLMs for Automated Exploit Generation
(AEG) against vulnerable smart contracts. We present \textsc{ReX}, a framework
integrating LLM-based exploit synthesis with the Foundry testing suite,
enabling the automated generation and validation of proof-of-concept (PoC)
exploits. We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude Opus 4, DeepSeek, and Qwen3 Plus) on both synthetic benchmarks and
real-world smart contracts affected by known high-impact exploits. Our results
show that modern LLMs can reliably generate functional PoC exploits for diverse
vulnerability types, with success rates reaching up to 92\%. Notably, Gemini
2.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 consistently outperform others in both synthetic and
real-world scenarios. We further analyze factors influencing AEG effectiveness,
including model capabilities, contract structure, and vulnerability types. We
also collect the first curated dataset of real-world PoC exploits to support
future research.

*Biswajit Chandra Das,M Saif Sartaz,Syed Ali Reza,Arat Hossain,Md Nasiruddin,Kanchon Kumar Bishnu,Kazi Sharmin Sultana,Sadia Sharmeen Shatyi,MD Azam Khan,Joynal Abed*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study explores the application of tailored AI models in cybersecurity across four areas: intrusion detection, malware classification, phishing detection, and insider threat analysis, emphasizing the importance of matching models to data characteristics for optimal threat detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of diverse cyber threats in the U.S. by developing specialized AI models that align with the inherent structures of problems like intrusion detection, malware classification, phishing, and insider threats.

Method: 1) Intrusion detection: unsupervised anomaly detection (isolation forest, deep autoencoders). 2) Malware classification: ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) trained on file/traffic features. 3) Phishing detection: standard classifiers (logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost). 4) Insider threat analysis: LSTM autoencoder with behavioral features in user activity logs.

Result: Intrusion detection methods successfully identified traffic anomalies. Ensemble models excelled in malware detection but lacked adaptability. Phishing models achieved high accuracy with minimal complexity. LSTM autoencoder captured all behavioral threats but produced numerous false positives, demonstrating a trade-off between sensitivity and precision.

Conclusion: The study underscores the significance of contextual problem structure over model complexity in cybersecurity. Simple models work for clear threats, while adaptive models (sequence models, anomaly detectors) are critical for subtle threats despite their drawbacks, emphasizing that context drives effective threat-mitigation strategies.

Abstract: This study examines how Artificial Intelligence can aid in identifying and
mitigating cyber threats in the U.S. across four key areas: intrusion
detection, malware classification, phishing detection, and insider threat
analysis. Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be
different approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the
problem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we
tested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep
autoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network
traffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like
Random Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic
logs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic
regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features.
These models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the
easiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different
story. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user
activity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of
harmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a
threat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise. What we saw
across the board is that performance was not about stacking the most complex
model. What mattered was how well the models structure matched the way the data
behaved. When signals were strong and obvious, simple models worked fine. But
for messier, more subtle threats, we needed something more adaptive, sequence
models and anomaly detectors, though they brought their trade offs. The
takeaway here is clear in cybersecurity, context drives the solution.

### [26] [Nakamoto Consensus from Multiple Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01448)
*Mirza Ahad Baig,Christoph U. Günther,Krzysztof Pietrzak*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes weight functions for securing longest-chain blockchains with space (S), verification (V), and work (W) resources. It classifies functions Γ(S,V,W) that are secure against private double-spending attacks when honest parties control more weight than adversaries. The results show homogeneity of degree one in V and W is key, with examples including Bitcoin’s work-based function and Chia’s space-time combination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bitcoin uses work-proportional consensus, while Chia introduces space and time (VDFs). This work aims to identify general weight functions combining S, V, W that ensure security under majority resource control, enabling better blockchain designs with mixed resources.

Method: The paper uses a continuous-time idealized model to prove that Γ(S,V,W) must be homogeneous of degree one in V and W for security. It then examines discrete-time models, imposing linear assumptions on S to ensure real-world applicability.

Result: In the continuous model, secure Γ functions are exactly those homogeneous in V and W. For discrete models, security requires mild S constraints (e.g., linearity in S). New secure examples include √(W₁W₂) and min{W₁,W₂}, outperforming existing approaches like W₁+W₂ in decentralization.

Conclusion: The classification provides a design framework for longest-chain blockchains, demonstrating that both Bitcoin and Chia’s approaches are special cases. Proposed alternatives like √(W₁W₂) are shown to better prevent centralization than summation-based methods.

Abstract: The blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain record the amount of work W that went
into creating them through proofs of work. When honest parties control a
majority of the work, consensus is achieved by picking the chain with the
highest recorded weight. Resources other than work have been considered to
secure such longest-chain blockchains. In Chia, blocks record the amount of
space S (via a proof of space) and sequential computational steps V (via a
VDF).
  In this paper, we ask what weight functions {\Gamma}(S,V,W) (that assign a
weight to a block as a function of the recorded space, speed, and work) are
secure in the sense that whenever the weight of the resources controlled by
honest parties is larger than the weight of adversarial parties, the blockchain
is secure against private double-spending attacks.
  We completely classify such functions in an idealized "continuous" model:
{\Gamma}(S,V,W) is secure against private double-spending attacks if and only
if it is homogeneous of degree one in the timed resources V and W, i.e.,
{\alpha}{\Gamma}(S,V,W)={\Gamma}(S,{\alpha}V, {\alpha}W). This includes Bitcoin
rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W)=W and Chia rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W) = SV. In a more realistic
model where blocks are created at discrete time-points, one additionally needs
some mild assumptions on the dependency on S (basically, the weight should not
grow too much if S is slightly increased, say linear as in Chia).
  Our classification is more general and allows various instantiations of the
same resource. It provides a powerful tool for designing new longest-chain
blockchains. E.g., consider combining different PoWs to counter centralization,
say the Bitcoin PoW W_1 and a memory-hard PoW W_2. Previous work suggested to
use W_1+W_2 as weight. Our results show that using
{\sqrt}(W_1){\cdot}{\sqrt}(W_2), {\min}{W_1,W_2} are also secure, and we argue
that in practice these are much better choices.

### [27] [Think Broad, Act Narrow: CWE Identification with Multi-Agent Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01451)
*Mohammed Sayagh,Mohammad Ghafari*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel multi-agent LLM approach to address three challenges in vulnerability detection: lack of deep analysis, insufficient contextual information, and incorrect CWE associations. The method shows promising results by reducing false positives and improving accuracy in synthetic programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based vulnerability detection struggles with distinguishing vulnerabilities from benign code due to (1) limited deep analysis in one-shot predictions, (2) reliance on function-level analysis without broader contextual evidence, and (3) failure to correctly associate vulnerabilities with the right Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers, which could mislead developers.

Method: The proposed approach employs three stages: 1) A team of LLM agents conducts an exhaustive search for potential CWEs in the target function. 2) Another agent group analyzes external context to support/refute each candidate CWE. 3) A final agent makes informed decisions about CWE acceptance/rejection based on the contextual evidence collected during prior stages.

Result: 1) Step 1 achieves 40.9% correct CWE identification rate on the PrimeVul dataset. 2) Full pipeline evaluation on ten synthetic programs reduces false positives from 6-9 CWEs to 1-2 while maintaining 9/10 true positive identification rates. The system demonstrates significantly better context-sensitive analysis compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The multi-agent LLM framework offers a promising solution to improve CWE detection accuracy by leveraging distributed analysis of functional and contextual evidence. Preliminary results suggest this approach enhances precision and reduces false positives through collaborative validation of vulnerability hypotheses, though broader evaluations are needed for final assessment.

Abstract: Machine learning and Large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection
has received significant attention in recent years. Unfortunately,
state-of-the-art techniques show that LLMs are unsuccessful in even
distinguishing the vulnerable function from its benign counterpart, due to
three main problems: Vulnerability detection requires deep analysis, which LLMs
often struggle with when making a one-shot prediction. Existing techniques
typically perform function-level analysis, whereas effective vulnerability
detection requires contextual information beyond the function scope. The focus
on binary classification can result in identifying a vulnerability but
associating it with the wrong security weaknesses (CWE), which may mislead
developers. We propose a novel multi-agent LLM approach to address the
challenges of identifying CWEs. This approach consists of three steps: (1) a
team of LLM agents performs an exhaustive search for potential CWEs in the
function under review, (2) another team of agents identifies relevant external
context to support or refute each candidate CWE, and (3) a final agent makes
informed acceptance or rejection decisions for each CWE based on the gathered
context. A preliminary evaluation of our approach shows promising results. In
the PrimeVul dataset, Step 1 correctly identifies the appropriate CWE in 40.9\%
of the studied vulnerable functions. We further evaluated the full pipeline on
ten synthetic programs and found that incorporating context information
significantly reduced false positives from 6 to 9 CWEs to just 1 to 2, while
still correctly identifying the true CWE in 9 out of 10 cases.

### [28] [VWAttacker: A Systematic Security Testing Framework for Voice over WiFi User Equipments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01469)
*Imtiaz Karim,Hyunwoo Lee,Hassan Asghar,Kazi Samin Mubasshir,Seulgi Han,Mashroor Hasan Bhuiyan,Elisa Bertino*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: VWAttacker is a systematic testing framework for VoWiFi UE security, using property-guided adversarial testing and LLM-based techniques to extract properties, generate testcases, detect 13 issues in 21 UEs, with one high-severity vulnerability acknowledged by MediaTek.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual methods for testing VoWiFi security are labor-intensive and inconsistent, risking undetected vulnerabilities. The paper addresses this by introducing a scalable, semi-automated framework.

Method: 1. Built a VoWiFi testbed interface to evaluate COTS UEs. 2. Developed an LLM-based approach for property extraction and testcase generation. 3. Mutated testcases via domain-specific transformations. 4. Implemented deterministic oracles to detect property violations.

Result: Extracted 63 properties from 11 specs, executed 1,116 testcases, identified 13 security issues (e.g., enforcing 0 as DH shared secret, supporting weak algorithms) in 21 UEs. One vulnerability received high-severity acknowledgment from MediaTek.

Conclusion: VWAttacker demonstrates the feasibility of systematic adversarial testing for VoWiFi security, automating property extraction and violation detection. Responsible disclosure practices and vendor collaboration are emphasized to enhance cellular network security.

Abstract: We present VWAttacker, the first systematic testing framework for analyzing
the security of Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) User Equipment (UE) implementations.
VWAttacker includes a complete VoWiFi network testbed that communicates with
Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) UEs based on a simple interface to test the
behavior of diverse VoWiFi UE implementations; uses property-guided adversarial
testing to uncover security issues in different UEs systematically. To reduce
manual effort in extracting and testing properties, we introduce an LLM-based,
semi-automatic, and scalable approach for property extraction and testcase (TC)
generation. These TCs are systematically mutated by two domain-specific
transformations. Furthermore, we introduce two deterministic oracles to detect
property violations automatically. Coupled with these techniques, VWAttacker
extracts 63 properties from 11 specifications, evaluates 1,116 testcases, and
detects 13 issues in 21 UEs. The issues range from enforcing a DH shared secret
to 0 to supporting weak algorithms. These issues result in attacks that expose
the victim UE's identity or establish weak channels, thus severely hampering
the security of cellular networks. We responsibly disclose the findings to all
the related vendors. At the time of writing, one of the vulnerabilities has
been acknowledged by MediaTek with high severity.

### [29] [Reconstructing Trust Embeddings from Siamese Trust Scores: A Direct-Sum Approach with Fixed-Point Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01479)
*Faruk Alpay,Taylan Alpay,Bugra Kilictas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to reconstruct high-dimensional device trust embeddings from noisy one-dimensional Siamese scores using a contraction mapping estimator, revealing privacy risks of publishing granular trust metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed-security frameworks often expose Siamese trust scores as single-dimensional proxies, but these scores may implicitly encode behavioral information that could be reconstructed and exploited, creating a tension between transparency for verification and confidentiality for privacy.

Method: The authors formalize the inverse problem of reconstruction by considering paired time-stamped score series from two independent agents. They derive a direct-sum estimator using four moment features and prove the existence of a unique fixed point for the reconstruction map under Banach contraction theory.

Result: Synthetic experiments (20 devices ×10 time steps) demonstrate the method recovers inter-device geometry despite Gaussian noise. Non-asymptotic error bounds explicitly link reconstruction accuracy to the length of score sequences.

Conclusion: The work highlights how publishing trust scores can leak latent device/metric details, proposes countermeasures like quantization with calibrated noise and obfuscated embeddings, and advocates for formal verification via publicly available reproduction assets (data, scripts, proofs).

Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust
embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many
distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents
that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we
formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that
concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the
resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction
argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x
10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the
recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean
and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error
bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond
methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing
granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both
devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score
quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them
within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI
systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the
submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.

### [30] [DALEQ -- Explainable Equivalence for Java Bytecode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01530)
*Jens Dietrich,Behnaz Hassanshahi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Daleq is a Java bytecode analysis tool that automates determining binary equivalence through normalization and Datalog-based provenance tracking, reducing manual effort in comparing rebuilt software artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of supply chain attacks (e.g., SolarWinds and xz) has led to secure rebuilding of open-source projects. However, verifying equivalence between original and rebuilt Java binaries remains labor-intensive due to build environment variations, as existing tools lack readable provenance explanations for equivalence assessments.

Method: 1. Disassemble Java bytecode into a relational database of structural features. 2. Apply Datalog rules to normalize this database across different build environments. 3. Generate Datalog proofs that track how equivalence is determined through normalization steps, providing verifiable explanations.

Result: Large-scale evaluation on 2,714 JAR pairs (265,690 class pairs) showed Daleq 1) Significantly reduces manual effort needed for non-bitwise binary comparisons 2) Outperforms existing bytecode tools in identifying equivalent artifacts 3) Provides formal provenance via Datalog proofs for all equivalence determinations.

Conclusion: Daleq fills a critical gap in software supply chain security by enabling explainable, automated equivalence verification of Java binaries. Its industrial evaluation demonstrates that it reduces manual analysis while being more accurate than current tools, with the added benefit of auditable Datalog-based justifications for decisions.

Abstract: The security of software builds has attracted increased attention in recent
years in response to incidents like solarwinds and xz. Now, several companies
including Oracle and Google rebuild open source projects in a secure
environment and publish the resulting binaries through dedicated repositories.
This practice enables direct comparison between these rebuilt binaries and the
original ones produced by developers and published in repositories such as
Maven Central. These binaries are often not bitwise identical; however, in most
cases, the differences can be attributed to variations in the build
environment, and the binaries can still be considered equivalent. Establishing
such equivalence, however, is a labor-intensive and error-prone process.
  While there are some tools that can be used for this purpose, they all fall
short of providing provenance, i.e. readable explanation of why two binaries
are equivalent, or not. To address this issue, we present daleq, a tool that
disassembles Java byte code into a relational database, and can normalise this
database by applying datalog rules. Those databases can then be used to infer
equivalence between two classes. Notably, equivalence statements are
accompanied with datalog proofs recording the normalisation process. We
demonstrate the impact of daleq in an industrial context through a large-scale
evaluation involving 2,714 pairs of jars, comprising 265,690 class pairs. In
this evaluation, daleq is compared to two existing bytecode transformation
tools. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in the manual effort
required to assess non-bitwise equivalent artifacts, which would otherwise
demand intensive human inspection. Furthermore, the results show that daleq
outperforms existing tools by identifying more artifacts rebuilt from the same
code as equivalent, even when no behavioral differences are present.

### [31] [Leveraging Machine Learning for Botnet Attack Detection in Edge-Computing Assisted IoT Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01542)
*Dulana Rupanetti,Naima Kaabouch*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) to enhance security in Edge-Computing-Assisted IoT networks against botnet attacks, focusing on detection accuracy and deployment feasibility on resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of IoT devices in large-scale networks has created security risks due to their reliance on edge computing, where a single compromised device can jeopardize the entire system. Botnet attacks, in particular, pose growing threats necessitating advanced cyber defense strategies.

Method: The authors conducted a comparative analysis of three ensemble learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) using the IoT network traffic dataset. They trained, tested, and evaluated these models for detecting and classifying botnet activities while assessing their applicability in low-resource edge/IoT environments.

Result: The study demonstrated that the evaluated machine learning models effectively detect botnet threats in IoT networks. Results emphasized lightGBM's potential for real-world deployment due to its efficiency and balance between performance and resource consumption.

Conclusion: Machine learning, specifically ensemble methods, can strengthen Edge-Computing-Assisted IoT networks against botnet attacks. The analysis provides practical insights into selecting models that balance accuracy with computational constraints for effective real-world implementation.

Abstract: The increase of IoT devices, driven by advancements in hardware technologies,
has led to widespread deployment in large-scale networks that process massive
amounts of data daily. However, the reliance on Edge Computing to manage these
devices has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, as attackers can
compromise entire networks by targeting a single IoT device. In light of
escalating cybersecurity threats, particularly botnet attacks, this paper
investigates the application of machine learning techniques to enhance security
in Edge-Computing-Assisted IoT environments. Specifically, it presents a
comparative analysis of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM -- three advanced
ensemble learning algorithms -- to address the dynamic and complex nature of
botnet threats. Utilizing a widely recognized IoT network traffic dataset
comprising benign and malicious instances, the models were trained, tested, and
evaluated for their accuracy in detecting and classifying botnet activities.
Furthermore, the study explores the feasibility of deploying these models in
resource-constrained edge and IoT devices, demonstrating their practical
applicability in real-world scenarios. The results highlight the potential of
machine learning to fortify IoT networks against emerging cybersecurity
challenges.

### [32] [BeDKD: Backdoor Defense based on Dynamic Knowledge Distillation and Directional Mapping Modulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01595)
*Zhengxian Wu,Juan Wen,Wanli Peng,Yinghan Zhou,Changtong dou,Yiming Xue*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces BeDKD, a backdoor defense method combining a directional mapping module for poisoned data identification and adversarial knowledge distillation (trust-punish cycle). It reduces ASR by 98% on three datasets while maintaining model performance (CACC), outperforming existing state-of-the-art defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor defenses require large clean datasets to degrade ASR but struggle with residual triggers, leading to persistently high attack success rates. A method effectively balancing robustness and low clean data requirements is urgently needed.

Method: 1) Directional mapping module: Identifies poisoned samples by maintaining backdoor mappings on intentionally flipped clean data while disrupting benign ones. 2) Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (KDD): Implements a two-phase cycle - 'trust distillation' (reinforcing clean mappings with identified unpoisoned data) and 'punish distillation' (suppressing backdoors through adversarial training with identified poisoned data).

Result: BeDKD achieved ≥98% reduction in ASR against mainstream attacks (e.g., BAE, SIG, ISS, LIRA) across three datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, TinyImageNet) while maintaining clean accuracy within 2% of the original model performance (CACC).

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the combination of directional mapping and adversarial knowledge distillation through trust-punish cycles effectively combats backdoors with minimal data requirements. BeDKD's defense efficiency and practical feasibility make it a promising advancement in secure machine learning. Code is publicly available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Although existing backdoor defenses have gained success in mitigating
backdoor attacks, they still face substantial challenges. In particular, most
of them rely on large amounts of clean data to weaken the backdoor mapping but
generally struggle with residual trigger effects, resulting in persistently
high attack success rates (ASR). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel
Backdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial
Knowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense
effectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned
data. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned
data, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small
set of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is
designed to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a
cycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean
and identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream
attacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD
surpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98% without
significantly reducing the CACC. Our code are available in
https://github.com/CAU-ISS-Lab/Backdoor-Attack-Defense-LLMs/tree/main/BeDKD.

### [33] [Practical, Generalizable and Robust Backdoor Attacks on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01605)
*Haoran Dai,Jiawen Wang,Ruo Yang,Manali Sharma,Zhonghao Liao,Yuan Hong,Binghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel backdoor attack framework for text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) that addresses existing limitations by using few backdoor samples, generalizing across multiple models, and overcoming current defenses with 90%+ attack success rate and minimal impact on benign generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies showed T2I DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, but prior methods rely on unrealistic prompts, lack generalizability, and can be mitigated by existing defenses. This creates a need for more practical and robust attack frameworks to test model security and drive better defenses.

Method: Proposed framework enables 1) backdoor generation with only 10 stealthy samples, 2) cross-model generalization without redesign, and 3) robustness against both existing and adaptive defenses through careful sample crafting and design.

Result: Experiments show >90% attack success rate on multiple T2I DMs with minimal benign image quality degradation, validated by human evaluation. Defenses including advanced detection and mitigation methods fail to neutralize the attack.

Conclusion: The vulnerable nature of T2I DMs highlights critical gaps in current backdoor mitigation strategies. The proposed attack framework demonstrates the need for fundamentally more robust defense mechanisms and better understanding of backdoor vulnerabilities in diffusion-based generation systems.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generating high-quality and diverse images from text prompts, yet recent
studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. Existing attack
methods suffer from critical limitations: 1) they rely on unnatural adversarial
prompts that lack human readability and require massive poisoned data; 2) their
effectiveness is typically restricted to specific models, lacking
generalizability; and 3) they can be mitigated by recent backdoor defenses.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel backdoor attack framework
that achieves three key properties: 1) \emph{Practicality}: Our attack requires
only a few stealthy backdoor samples to generate arbitrary attacker-chosen
target images, as well as ensuring high-quality image generation in benign
scenarios. 2) \emph{Generalizability:} The attack is applicable across multiple
T2I DMs without requiring model-specific redesign. 3) \emph{Robustness:} The
attack remains effective against existing backdoor defenses and adaptive
defenses. Our extensive experimental results on multiple T2I DMs demonstrate
that with only 10 carefully crafted backdoored samples, our attack method
achieves $>$90\% attack success rate with negligible degradation in benign
image generation quality. We also conduct human evaluation to validate our
attack effectiveness. Furthermore, recent backdoor detection and mitigation
methods, as well as adaptive defense tailored to our attack are not
sufficiently effective, highlighting the pressing need for more robust defense
mechanisms against the proposed attack.

*Dong Chen,Tong Yang,Feipeng Zhai,Pengpeng Ouyang,Qidong Liu,Yafei Li,Chong Fu,Mingliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Semantic Encryption (SE) is a framework that preserves privacy and utility in cloud-based large language models by encoding user inputs to obfuscate sensitive information while maintaining semantic structure, then decoding responses without compromising data utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing encryption methods for cloud-based language models (CLLMs) sacrifice data utility and performance by neglecting the logical structure of user inputs, hindering effective interactions.

Method: SE employs two components: (1) Semantic Encoding: A lightweight local model transforms input into an alternative semantic context, preserving intent/structure and hiding sensitive data; (2) Semantic Decoding: Reconstructs the CLLM's response to the original context using local stored input to maintain user experience.

Result: Experiments demonstrated effective data privacy protection without compromising utility or user experience, with SE outperforming state-of-the-art InferDPT across metrics and datasets.

Conclusion: SE provides a practical solution for secure CLLM interactions by balancing privacy and utility through semantic-aware encoding/decoding, outperforming existing methods in real-world effectiveness.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Cloud-based Large Language Models (CLLMs) has
raised significant concerns regarding data privacy during user interactions.
While existing approaches primarily focus on encrypting sensitive information,
they often overlook the logical structure of user inputs. This oversight can
lead to reduced data utility and degraded performance of CLLMs. To address
these limitations and enable secure yet effective interactions, we propose
Semantic Encryption (SE)-a plug-and-play framework designed to preserve both
privacy and utility. SE consists of two key components: Semantic Encoding and
Semantic Decoding. In the encoding phase, a lightweight local model transforms
the original user input into an alternative semantic context that maintains the
original intent and logical structure while obfuscating sensitive information.
This transformed input is then processed by the CLLM, which generates a
response based on the transformed semantic context. To maintain a seamless user
experience, the decoding phase will reconstruct the CLLM's response back into
the original semantic context by referencing the locally stored user input.
Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SE effectively protects
data privacy without compromising data utility or user experience, offering a
practical solution for secure interaction with CLLMs. Particularly, the
proposed SE demonstrates a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
InferDPT, surpassing it across various evaluated metrics and datasets.

TL;DR: JSidentify-V2 is a dynamic analysis framework that detects mini-game plagiarism by leveraging runtime memory invariants, overcoming limitations of static analysis tools against sophisticated obfuscation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static analysis tools fail to detect plagiarism in deeply obfuscated mini-games (e.g., encrypted code with decryption keys) due to code structure destruction.

Method: 1) Static pre-analysis/instrumentation to identify memory invariants; 2) Adaptive hot object slicing for critical code coverage; 3) Memory Dependency Graph construction for obfuscation-resilient fingerprints; 4) Graph-based similarity analysis for plagiarism detection.

Result: Evaluated against eight obfuscation methods on a dataset of 1,200 mini-games... (abstract incomplete)

Conclusion: Runtime memory behavior patterns provide stable fingerprints for detecting obfuscated code, enabling effective plagiarism detection in mini-game platforms.

Abstract: The explosive growth of mini-game platforms has led to widespread code
plagiarism, where malicious users access popular games' source code and
republish them with modifications. While existing static analysis tools can
detect simple obfuscation techniques like variable renaming and dead code
injection, they fail against sophisticated deep obfuscation methods such as
encrypted code with local or cloud-based decryption keys that completely
destroy code structure and render traditional Abstract Syntax Tree analysis
ineffective. To address these challenges, we present JSidentify-V2, a novel
dynamic analysis framework that detects mini-game plagiarism by capturing
memory invariants during program execution. Our key insight is that while
obfuscation can severely distort static code characteristics, runtime memory
behavior patterns remain relatively stable. JSidentify-V2 employs a four-stage
pipeline: (1) static pre-analysis and instrumentation to identify potential
memory invariants, (2) adaptive hot object slicing to maximize execution
coverage of critical code segments, (3) Memory Dependency Graph construction to
represent behavioral fingerprints resilient to obfuscation, and (4) graph-based
similarity analysis for plagiarism detection.
  We evaluate JSidentify-V2 against eight obfuscation methods on a
comprehensive dataset of 1,200 mini-games ...

*Man Hu,Yahui Ding,Yatao Yang,Liangyu Chen,Yanhao Jia,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DUP is a parameter-efficient framework that unifies backdoor detection and purification via detection-guided unlearning, replacing retraining with knowledge distillation to remove poison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defenses for backdoor attacks rely on coarse-grained detection metrics and require full retraining or external clean models, creating inefficiencies and dependencies.

Method: 1) Detects backdoors using class-agnostic distances and inter-layer transition analysis with dynamic weighting. 2) Purifies models through knowledge distillation where student models diverge from teacher predictions on detected poison without retraining.

Result: Experiments show superior performance across diverse attacks (detection accuracy) and model architectures (purification efficacy) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DUP establishes an effective backdoor defense paradigm by explicitly isolating and unlearning poison-induced knowledge from detection signals using a novel distillation framework.

Abstract: As backdoor attacks become more stealthy and robust, they reveal critical
weaknesses in current defense strategies: detection methods often rely on
coarse-grained feature statistics, and purification methods typically require
full retraining or additional clean models. To address these challenges, we
propose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework
that integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The
detector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic
distances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through
a weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained
analysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a
parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does
not require any external clean model. Specifically, we innovatively repurpose
knowledge distillation to guide the student model toward increasing its output
divergence from the teacher on detected poisoned samples, effectively forcing
it to unlearn the backdoor behavior. Extensive experiments across diverse
attack methods and language model architectures demonstrate that DUP achieves
superior defense performance in detection accuracy and purification efficacy.

### [37] [LLM-Assisted Model-Based Fuzzing of Protocol Implementations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01750)
*Changze Huang,Di Wang,Zhi Quan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an LLM-assisted fuzzing framework for automatically generating test sequences to uncover vulnerabilities in network protocol implementations, successfully identifying 12 previously unknown bugs in three major protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional protocol testing via Markovian state models requires significant manual effort and domain expertise, making it time-consuming and difficult to scale across multiple protocols.

Method: The method defines full protocol state space, uses LLMs to select representative states, and generates protocol-specific sequence generators through code-prompting to create test inputs under various conditions.

Result: Evaluation on three network protocol implementations revealed 12 new vulnerabilities, with all findings reported to developers for confirmation.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-assisted framework demonstrates practical effectiveness in identifying real-world security issues in network protocols, overcoming limitations of manual modeling approaches.

Abstract: Testing network protocol implementations is critical for ensuring the
reliability, security, and interoperability of distributed systems. Faults in
protocol behavior can lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, especially
in real-time and mission-critical applications. A common approach to protocol
testing involves constructing Markovian models that capture the state
transitions and expected behaviors of the protocol. However, building such
models typically requires significant domain expertise and manual effort,
making the process time-consuming and difficult to scale across diverse
protocols and implementations.
  We propose a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
automatically generate sequences for testing network protocol implementations.
Our approach begins by defining the full set of possible protocol states, from
which the LLM selects a subset to model the target implementation. Using this
state-based model, we prompt the LLM to generate code that produces sequences
of states. This program serves as a protocol-specific sequences generator. The
sequences generator then generates test inputs to call the protocol
implementation under various conditions. We evaluated our approach on three
widely used network protocol implementations and successfully identified 12
previously unknown vulnerabilities. We have reported them to the respective
developers for confirmation. This demonstrates the practical effectiveness of
our LLM-assisted fuzzing framework in uncovering real-world security issues.

TL;DR: This paper discusses implementing a Zero Trust architecture using reverse proxy, mTLS, and centralized SSO to secure access for distributed workforces, emphasizing challenges faced and lessons learned during deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional access methods like VPNs and SSO are insufficient for securely scaling access in dynamic, distributed enterprise environments.

Method: A multidimensional Zero Trust-aligned architecture combining reverse proxy integration with Mutual TLS (mTLS), centralized SSO, per-device/user authentication, and policy enforcement with observability layers.

Result: Organizations achieved secure and seamless internal application access through the implemented architecture, though specific metrics aren't detailed beyond outlining encountered challenges.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that modern Zero Trust solutions with hybrid authentication mechanisms and centralized policy enforcement are critical for addressing enterprise access control needs in evolving workflow paradigms.

Abstract: In today's enterprise environment, traditional access methods such as Virtual
Private Networks (VPNs) and application-specific Single Sign-On (SSO) often
fall short when it comes to securely scaling access for a distributed and
dynamic workforce. This paper presents our experience implementing a modern,
Zero Trust-aligned architecture that leverages a reverse proxy integrated with
Mutual TLS (mTLS) and centralized SSO, along with the key challenges we
encountered and lessons learned during its deployment and scaling. This
multidimensional solution involves both per-device and per-user authentication,
centralized enforcement of security policies, and comprehensive observability,
hence enabling organizations to deliver secure and seamless access to their
internal applications.

*Nicolas Rodriguez Alvarez,Fernando Rodriguez Merino*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates CRYSTALS-Kyber's practicality as a quantum-resistant encryption scheme, demonstrating its security and performance on commodity hardware with standard acceleration features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computers threaten RSA and ECC cryptography via Shor's algorithm, but post-quantum solutions like Kyber face adoption challenges similar to SHA-1 to SHA-2 transitions which leave security gaps.

Method: Performance testing of Kyber across implementation schemes using standard processor accelerations (AES-NI, ASIMD) without specialized hardware.

Result: Kyber maintains quantum security while achieving acceptable performance metrics for most applications on standard commodity hardware with manufacturer-provided acceleration features.

Conclusion: Kyber represents a viable post-quantum cryptographic transition option that balances security requirements with current computing infrastructure limitations.

Abstract: The steady advancement in quantum computer error correction technology has
pushed the current record to 48 stable logical qubits, bringing us closer to
machines capable of running Shor's algorithm at scales that threaten RSA and
ECC cryptography. While the timeline for developing such quantum computers
remains uncertain, the cryptographic community must prepare for the transition
to quantum-resistant algorithms. CRYSTALS-Kyber, standardized by NIST in 2022,
represents a leading post-quantum cryptographic solution, but widespread
adoption faces significant challenges. If this migration follows patterns
similar to the SHA-1 to SHA-2 transition, organizations may experience
prolonged periods of vulnerability, with substantial security and economic
consequences. This study evaluates Kyber's practical viability through
performance testing across various implementation schemes, utilizing only
standard built-in processor acceleration features, some of which include AES-NI
and ASIMD, without any specialized hardware additions. Our findings demonstrate
that Kyber provides robust security guarantees against quantum attacks while
maintaining acceptable performance profiles for most contemporary applications,
utilizing only commodity hardware with manufacturer-provided acceleration
capabilities.

*Chao Ge,Wei Yuan,Ge Chen,Yanbin Pan,Yuan Shen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decentralized anonymous routing protocol with information-theoretic identity privacy guarantees and practical feasibility, addressing vulnerabilities to AI metadata analysis and traditional trust models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anonymous networks struggle with AI-powered metadata attacks, decentralized architecture challenges, and lack guaranteed security against adversaries.

Method: The protocol eliminates reliance on threshold models and trusted third parties, incorporating formal proofs of indistinguishable identity privacy through rigorous cryptographic analysis.

Result: Simulations demonstrate the protocol achieves secure anonymous communication while maintaining efficiency, confirming resistance to advanced tracing/traffic analysis techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol establishes provable security guarantees for decentralized anonymous communication, overcoming critical limitations of state-of-the-art systems in adversarial environments.

Abstract: Anonymous communication networks have emerged as crucial tools for
obfuscating communication pathways and concealing user identities. However,
their practical deployments face significant challenges, including
susceptibility to artificial intelligence (AI)-powered metadata analysis,
difficulties in decentralized architectures, and the absence of provable
security guarantees. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
decentralized anonymous routing protocol with resistance to tracing and traffic
analysis. The protocol eliminates dependencies on the threshold model and
trusted third-party setups, ensuring indistinguishable identity privacy even in
highly adversarial environments. Different from traditional empirical security
analysis of anonymous networks, this paper rigorously proves indistinguishable
identity privacy for users even in extremely adversarial environments.
Furthermore, simulations confirm its practical feasibility, demonstrating both
security and efficiency. By achieving information sharing with privacy
preservation, the proposed protocol offers a provably secure solution for
privacy-preserving communication in digital environments.

### [41] ["Energon": Unveiling Transformers from GPU Power and Thermal Side-Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01768)
*Arunava Chaudhuri,Shubhi Shukla,Sarani Bhattacharya,Debdeep Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel GPU side-channel attack via monitoring power and thermal fluctuations in shared MLaaS environments, successfully extracting transformer model architectures and enabling highly effective adversarial attacks (93%+ success rate) with minimal privilege.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread deployment of high-value pre-trained transformer models in shared GPU infrastructures through MLaaS services creates a critical security need to understand data confidentiality risks from non-physical side-channel attacks on underlying hardware, which are currently underexplored in academic research.

Method: The authors developed a user-privilege exploitation framework that analyzes GPU-level power consumption and thermal signature patterns during transformer model execution to reconstruct architectural features including encoder/decoder layers and attention heads, validated across both language and vision transformer architectures.

Result: The attack model achieved median 89% accuracy for identifying model family types and 100% accuracy for hyperparameter classification. These results were reproduced consistently in single-process environments (93% attack success) and extended to noisy multi-process conditions (88% success for architecture inference).

Conclusion: This work establishes GPU power and thermal telemetry as practical and reliable side-channel attack vectors against deployed transformer models, demonstrating that even in shared computing environments where physical access is impossible, sensitive model characteristics can still be reconstructed with near-perfect accuracy for adversarial use.

Abstract: Transformers have become the backbone of many Machine Learning (ML)
applications, including language translation, summarization, and computer
vision. As these models are increasingly deployed in shared Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU) environments via Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), concerns
around their security grow. In particular, the risk of side-channel attacks
that reveal architectural details without physical access remains
underexplored, despite the high value of the proprietary models they target.
This work to the best of our knowledge is the first to investigate GPU power
and thermal fluctuations as side-channels and further exploit them to extract
information from pre-trained transformer models. The proposed analysis shows
how these side channels can be exploited at user-privilege to reveal critical
architectural details such as encoder/decoder layer and attention head for both
language and vision transformers. We demonstrate the practical impact by
evaluating multiple language and vision pre-trained transformers which are
publicly available. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate
that the attack model achieves a high accuracy of over 89% on average for model
family identification and 100% for hyperparameter classification, in both
single-process as well as noisy multi-process scenarios. Moreover, by
leveraging the extracted architectural information, we demonstrate highly
effective black-box transfer adversarial attacks with an average success rate
exceeding 93%, underscoring the security risks posed by GPU side-channel
leakage in deployed transformer models.

### [42] [RouteMark: A Fingerprint for Intellectual Property Attribution in Routing-based Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01784)
*Xin He,Junxi Shen,Zhenheng Tang,Xiaowen Chu,Bo Li,Ivor W. Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RouteMark is a framework for protecting and attributing intellectual property in merged Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by leveraging expert-specific routing fingerprints. It uses stable activation patterns of task-specific experts to detect reuse and tampering, demonstrating robustness against structural and parametric modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model merging via MoE enables efficient multi-task integration, but lacks mechanisms to protect and attribute the intellectual property of individual task-specific experts after consolidation. This creates a need for robust IP verification tools to address potential reuse, theft, or tampering of experts.

Method: 1. **Expert Routing Fingerprints**: Identifies two complementary statistics: Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying expert activation intensity under probing inputs; and Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF), describing the input distribution that preferentially activates an expert. 2. **Similarity-Based Matching Algorithm**: Compares expert fingerprints between suspected and reference models to determine attribution or tampering.

Result: RouteMark achieves consistent high similarity scores for correctly attributed reused experts and significant separation from unrelated models. It remains effective against tampering techniques like expert replacement/deletion, fine-tuning, pruning, and permutation, outperforming weight- and activation-based baselines across diverse tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures.

Conclusion: RouteMark establishes a practical and broadly applicable framework for IP verification in MoE model merging. Its reproducible, lightweight design and robust tampering resistance make it a foundational solution for securing intellectual property in sparse, multi-task architectures.

Abstract: Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution
for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse
architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a
distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm
introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect
the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose
RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the
design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific
experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.
To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two
complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the
intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),
characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each
expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and
lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce
a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between
a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields
high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones.
Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert
replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning,
pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness.
Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly
applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.

etc. Then, we review recent works that employ MPC and HE as solutions for these
use cases in detail. Our survey highlights the applicability of these

### [44] [Complete Evasion, Zero Modification: PDF Attacks on AI Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01887)
*Aldan Creo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PDFuzz exploits PDF document structure vulnerabilities to evade AI-generated text detectors by scrambling extraction sequences via character positioning manipulation while preserving visual layout, dropping detector performance to random levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper highlights the critical need for robust AI-generated text detection systems amidst rising evasion attacks. Current detectors, such as ArguGPT, lack resilience against manipulations in PDF document structures, creating a loophole that could undermine authenticity verification in digital content.

Method: PDFuzz introduces an attack methodology that modifies character positions in PDFs to disorder the text extraction sequence while maintaining exact textual content and visual fidelity. This manipulation targets the inherent discrepancy between visual layout and machine-extracted text data, enabling evasion of detection algorithms reliant on sequential analysis.

Result: Evaluation against ArguGPT shows complete evasion effectiveness: detector accuracy decreases from 93.6% to 50.4%, with an F1 score dropping to 0.0. Importantly, this degradation occurs without altering the text's visual appearance, demonstrating the attack's potency and stealthiness.

Conclusion: The findings reveal structural vulnerabilities in PDF-based text detection systems, necessitating the development of more robust architectures that account for visual and structural PDF characteristics. The open-source release of PDFuzz (https://github.com/ACMCMC/PDFuzz) provides a benchmark for improving detectors against such layout-based attacks.

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have become essential tools for maintaining
content authenticity, yet their robustness against evasion attacks remains
questionable. We present PDFuzz, a novel attack that exploits the discrepancy
between visual text layout and extraction order in PDF documents. Our method
preserves exact textual content while manipulating character positioning to
scramble extraction sequences. We evaluate this approach against the ArguGPT
detector using a dataset of human and AI-generated text. Our results
demonstrate complete evasion: detector performance drops from (93.6 $\pm$ 1.4)
% accuracy and 0.938 $\pm$ 0.014 F1 score to random-level performance ((50.4
$\pm$ 3.2) % accuracy, 0.0 F1 score) while maintaining perfect visual fidelity.
Our work reveals a vulnerability in current detection systems that is inherent
to PDF document structures and underscores the need for implementing sturdy
safeguards against such attacks. We make our code publicly available at
https://github.com/ACMCMC/PDFuzz.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mirai's devastating impact, rapid spread, and undetectable features necessitated analysis of its variants for understanding modern botnet threats and improving IoT security defenses.

Method: The study analyzes the variants' exploitation of vulnerabilities (improper input validation, command injection, etc.) through code and infection mechanism analysis, comparing their strategies and targets.

Result: Satori infected 700,000+ devices; Mukashi targeted 100M+ Zyxel NAS units. The analysis reveals 15 vulnerabilities exploited across 2014-2021 via shared attack patterns.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the critical need for IoT device manufacturers to address persistent vulnerabilities (2014-2021) and implements robust security measures to combat evolving botnet threats.

Abstract: Mirai is undoubtedly one of the most significant Internet of Things (IoT)
botnet attacks in history. In terms of its detrimental effects, seamless
spread, and low detection rate, it surpassed its predecessors. Its developers
released the source code, which triggered the development of several variants
that combined the old code with newer vulnerabilities found on popular IoT
devices. The prominent variants, Satori, Mukashi, Moobot, and Sonic1, together
target more than 15 unique known vulnerabilities discovered between 2014-2021.
The vulnerabilities include but are not limited to improper input validation,
command injections, insufficient credential protection, and out-of-bound
writes. With these new attack strategies, Satori compromised more than a
quarter million devices within the first twelve hours of its release and peaked
at almost 700,000 infected devices. Similarly, Mukashi made more than a hundred
million Zyxel NAS devices vulnerable through its new exploits. This article
reviews the attack methodologies and impacts of these variants in detail. It
summarizes the common vulnerabilities targeted by these variants and analyzes
the infection mechanism through vulnerability analysis. This article also
provides an overview of possible defense solutions.

### [46] [A Decentralized Framework for Ethical Authorship Validation in Academic Publishing: Leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity and Blockchain Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01913)
*Kamal Al-Sabahi,Yousuf Khamis Al Mabsali*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Presents a decentralized academic publishing framework using SSI and blockchain to enhance ethical authorship verification and conflict-of-interest detection through DIDs, VCs, and ZKPs, with stakeholder survey validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing academic publishing systems face ethical challenges like unconsented authorship and undisclosed conflicts of interest. Current infrastructure (e.g., ORCID) lacks capabilities for explicit authorship consent, role verification, and conflict-of-interest detection during peer review.

Method: Developed a decentralized framework combining Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) with blockchain technology. Uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for identity/role verification, blockchain for immutable trust registry of authorship consent and peer-review activity, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving conflict detection.

Result: Verified authorship metadata and consent records are integrable into publications. Stakeholder surveys showed the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in scholarly communication. System effectively reduces authorship ambiguity and ensures transparency.

Conclusion: The proposed SSI/blockchain-based solution advances academic publishing by establishing verifiable, transparent, and accountable authorship practices. This work enables a more trustworthy knowledge dissemination ecosystem through cryptographic enforcement of ethical standards.

Abstract: Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific
advancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as
unconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed
conflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively
disambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit
authorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly
detecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these
shortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model
uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to
securely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and
ensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records
authorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving
cryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support
conflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified
authorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications,
increasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and
reviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in
scholarly communication. This work represents a step toward a more transparent,
accountable, and trustworthy academic publishing ecosystem.

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) face unprecedented security
challenges due to their inherent characteristics, such as multidimensional
heterogeneity and dynamic topologies. These characteristics fundamentally
undermine conventional security methods and traditional artificial intelligence
(AI)-driven solutions. Generative AI (GAI) is a transformative approach that
can safeguard SAGIN security by synthesizing data, understanding semantics, and
making autonomous decisions. This survey fills existing review gaps by
examining GAI-empowered secure communications across SAGINs. First, we
introduce secured SAGINs and highlight GAI's advantages over traditional AI for
security defenses. Then, we explain how GAI mitigates failures of authenticity,
breaches of confidentiality, tampering of integrity, and disruptions of
availability across the physical, data link, and network layers of SAGINs.
Three step-by-step tutorials discuss how to apply GAI to solve specific
problems using concrete methods, emphasizing its generative paradigm beyond

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses GPU security vulnerabilities in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) by demonstrating how unauthorized crypto mining degrades AI workload performance and proposing a detection framework using telemetry data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPUs in ITS are critical for high-performance computing but remain largely unmonitored, leaving them exposed to cyberattacks and misuse like crypto mining that could compromise safety-critical applications.

Method: The authors conducted a case study using a YOLOv8 video processing pipeline on an RTX 2060 GPU with simultaneous T-Rex crypto miner execution. They monitored performance shifts via GPU telemetry (nvidia-smi) and Nsight Compute profiling, then trained lightweight classification models on extracted telemetry features to detect misuse.

Result: Unauthorized crypto mining caused a 50% frame rate drop and 90% power consumption increase during AI workloads. Trained classifiers achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in detecting these anomalies.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the urgent need for improved GPU observability in ITS and presents a scalable framework for detecting GPU misuse through on-device telemetry, crucial for securing autonomous vehicles and edge devices.

Abstract: Graphics processing units (GPUs) are becoming an essential part of the
intelligent transportation system (ITS) for enabling video-based and artificial
intelligence (AI) based applications. GPUs provide high-throughput and
energy-efficient computing for tasks like sensor fusion and roadside video
analytics. However, these GPUs are one of the most unmonitored components in
terms of security. This makes them vulnerable to cyber and hardware attacks,
including unauthorized crypto mining. This paper highlights GPU security as a
critical blind spot in transportation cybersecurity. To support this concern,
it also presents a case study showing the impact of stealthy unauthorized
crypto miners on critical AI workloads, along with a detection strategy. We
used a YOLOv8-based video processing pipeline running on an RTX 2060 GPU for
the case study. A multi-streaming application was executed while a T-Rex crypto
miner ran in the background. We monitored how the miner degraded GPU
performance by reducing the frame rate and increasing power consumption, which
could be a serious concern for GPUs operating in autonomous vehicles or
battery-powered edge devices. We observed measurable impacts using GPU
telemetry (nvidia-smi) and Nsight Compute profiling, where frame rate dropped
by 50 percent, and power usage increased by up to 90%. To detect, we trained
lightweight classifiers using extracted telemetry features. All models achieved
high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This paper raises urgent
awareness about GPU observability gaps in ITS and offers a replicable framework
for detecting GPU misuse through on-device telemetry.

Motivation: The proliferation of generative AI introduces risks such as unauthorized digital cloning, impersonation, and monetization of identity data, necessitating robust governance models.

Method: DIRF is structured into nine domains with 63 controls, integrating legal frameworks, technical solutions (e.g., traceability), and hybrid mechanisms (e.g., consent enforcement) to secure identity rights.

Result: The paper establishes architectural foundations, strategies, and use cases demonstrating the feasibility of a unified framework to address AI-driven identity exploitation.

Conclusion: DIRF emphasizes the critical need for standardized controls to enforce digital identity rights in AI ecosystems, guiding platforms and regulators toward secure and ethical implementation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) pose significant threats to the integrity of personal
identity, including digital cloning, sophisticated impersonation, and the
unauthorized monetization of identity-related data. Mitigating these risks
necessitates the development of robust AI-generated content detection systems,

Digital Identity Rights Framework (DIRF), a structured security and governance
model designed to protect behavioral, biometric, and personality-based digital
likeness attributes to address this critical need. Structured across nine
domains and 63 controls, DIRF integrates legal, technical, and hybrid
enforcement mechanisms to secure digital identity consent, traceability, and
monetization. We present the architectural foundations, enforcement strategies,
and key use cases supporting the need for a unified framework. This work aims

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study analyzes Android app permission trends, revealing that malicious apps now request fewer permissions to avoid detection while benign apps require more for functionality. Using FP-Growth association rule mining on Google Play data, it identifies co-occurring permission patterns across 16 app genres, emphasizing the need for improved monitoring and regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Android app permissions are critical for security, but persistent abuse undermines user trust despite documented guidelines. Understanding evolving patterns helps address misuse.

Method: 1) Analyzed Google Play Store apps over time and by features (ads, purchases, etc.)
2) Used FP-Growth algorithm for association rule mining on permission datasets
3) Categorized permissions into semantic groups for contextual analysis

Result: 1) Malicious apps request fewer permissions (stealth strategy)
2) Benign apps increasingly request more permissions (functionality demands)
3) Identified genre-specific permission patterns and high-impact combinations
4) Revealed significant temporal changes in permission usage trends

Conclusion: Permission usage strategies are diverging between benign/malicious apps, creating new privacy challenges. The structured analysis approach enables better detection of abnormal patterns and reinforces the need for continuous ecosystem monitoring and user education programs.

Abstract: The proper use of Android app permissions is crucial to the success and
security of these apps. Users must agree to permission requests when installing
or running their apps. Despite official Android platform documentation on
proper permission usage, there are still many cases of permission abuse. This
study provides a comprehensive analysis of the Android permission landscape,
highlighting trends and patterns in permission requests across various
applications from the Google Play Store. By distinguishing between benign and
malicious applications, we uncover developers' evolving strategies, with
malicious apps increasingly requesting fewer permissions to evade detection,
while benign apps request more to enhance functionality. In addition to
examining permission trends across years and app features such as
advertisements, in-app purchases, content ratings, and app sizes, we leverage
association rule mining using the FP-Growth algorithm. This allows us to
uncover frequent permission combinations across the entire dataset, specific
years, and 16 app genres. The analysis reveals significant differences in
permission usage patterns, providing a deeper understanding of co-occurring
permissions and their implications for user privacy and app functionality. By
categorizing permissions into high-level semantic groups and examining their
application across distinct app categories, this study offers a structured
approach to analyzing the dynamics within the Android ecosystem. The findings
emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring, user education, and
regulatory oversight to address permission misuse effectively.

*Hiroki Nakano,Takashi Koide,Daiki Chiba*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PhishParrot uses LLMs to create adaptive user profiles for detecting cloaked phishing sites, achieving a 33.8% accuracy improvement over 21 days.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phishing detection systems are ineffective against cloaking techniques, which hide malicious content from security crawlers while appearing legitimate to targets. This research addresses the urgent need for a more effective approach to detect such evasive attacks.

Method: PhishParrot analyzes phishing site data with LLMs to identify cloaking patterns, constructs user profiles based on similar-case extraction, and dynamically adjusts browser/network configurations to mimic attacker-targeted conditions for optimal crawling.

Result: The 21-day evaluation demonstrated 33.8% higher detection accuracy compared to standard systems, with 91 distinct crawling environments generated to expose cloaked content under various attack scenarios.

Conclusion: PhishParrot's integration of LLM contextual analysis and adaptive crawling environments provides an effective solution for detecting cloaked phishing attacks, outperforming existing methods through targeted user profile simulation.

Abstract: Phishing attacks continue to evolve, with cloaking techniques posing a
significant challenge to detection efforts. Cloaking allows attackers to
display phishing sites only to specific users while presenting legitimate pages
to security crawlers, rendering traditional detection systems ineffective. This
research proposes PhishParrot, a novel crawling environment optimization system
designed to counter cloaking techniques. PhishParrot leverages the contextual
analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify potential
patterns in crawling information, enabling the construction of optimal user
profiles capable of bypassing cloaking mechanisms. The system accumulates
information on phishing sites collected from diverse environments. It then
adapts browser settings and network configurations to match the attacker's
target user conditions based on information extracted from similar cases. A
21-day evaluation showed that PhishParrot improved detection accuracy by up to
33.8% over standard analysis systems, yielding 91 distinct crawling
environments for diverse conditions targeted by attackers. The findings confirm
that the combination of similar-case extraction and LLM-based context analysis
is an effective approach for detecting cloaked phishing attacks.

TL;DR: FPEdit is a novel knowledge-editing framework that injects stealthy, semantically coherent natural language fingerprints into large language models by sparsely modifying model weights. It maintains 95-100% fingerprint retention while preserving performance on 24 benchmarks and reducing resource requirements by 70% compared to existing techniques. The method enables reliable provenance verification in adversarial scenarios like fine-tuning and black-box deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM fingerprinting approaches struggle with either requiring full parameter access (intrinsic methods) or being vulnerable to detection via statistically anomalous triggers (backdoor techniques), leaving LLMs exposed to unauthorized redistribution and commercial exploitation.

Method: FPEdit modifies a sparse subset of model weights (instead of all parameters) to inject semantically coherent natural language fingerprints. These fingerprints are 'aware' of the model's ownership information while maintaining functional performance through careful weight modifications.

Result: 1) 95-100% fingerprint retention after full-parameter fine-tuning or parameter-efficient adaptation (like LoRA)
2) 70% reduction in resource requirements compared to existing fingerprinting methods
3) Preserves performance on 24 downstream benchmarks
4) Robust to quantization, pruning, and stochastic decoding
5) Can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in <10 minutes with <32GB GPU memory

Conclusion: FPEdit establishes the first fingerprinting approach for LLMs that simultaneously achieves robustness against model adaptations, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility. It provides a practical solution for provenance verification in adversarial deployment environments with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data,
and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual
assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized
redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box
deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based
techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered
by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel
knowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language
fingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This ensures
stealthy and precise ownership encoding without degrading the core
functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\%$
fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream
benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and
stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under
10 minutes using less than 32 GB of GPU memory, a $70\%$ reduction in resource
requirements compared to existing techniques. These advances establish FPEdit
as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness
against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility,
providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of
large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.

### [53] [Coward: Toward Practical Proactive Federated Backdoor Defense via Collision-based Watermark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02115)
*Wenjie Li,Siying Gu,Yiming Li,Kangjie Chen,Zhili Chen,Tianwei Zhang,Shu-Tao Xia,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Coward, a proactive backdoor detection method in federated learning, which mitigates OOD bias by levering multi-backdoor collision effects, erasing conflicting watermarks during local training to identify attackers, and demonstrated resilience via experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor detection in federated learning is limited: passive methods fail under data heterogeneity and client randomness, while proactive methods face OOD bias due to backdoor co-existence assumptions.

Method: Coward uses multi-backdoor collision effects by injecting conflicting global watermarks, then detecting attackers based on watermark erasure during local training, while revising the detection mechanism to reduce OOD bias.

Result: Extensive experiments show Coward effectively detects backdoors and resists adaptive attacks on benchmark datasets, with code available for verification.

Conclusion: Coward addresses FL backdoor vulnerabilities by overcoming prior limitations through its collision-based detection mechanism, offering a robust proactive defense solution.

Abstract: Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor
attacks in federated learning (FL), where malicious clients upload poisoned
updates that compromise the global model and undermine the reliability of FL
deployments. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories,
including passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server
proactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations
in practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data
distributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive
defenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on
backdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new
proactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor
collision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors
significantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by
evaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased
during local training rather than retained. Our method preserves the advantages
of proactive defenses in handling data heterogeneity (\ie, non-i.i.d. data)
while mitigating the adverse impact of OOD bias through a revised detection
mechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the
effectiveness of Coward and its resilience to potential adaptive attacks. The
code for our method would be available at

### [54] [SUAD: Solid-Channel Ultrasound Injection Attack and Defense to Voice Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02116)
*Chao Liu,Zhezheng Zhu,Hao Chen,Zhe Chen,Kaiwen Guo,Penghao Wang,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes SUAD Attack, a long-range cross-barrier inaudible voice attack, and SUAD Defense, a defense mechanism using ultrasonic perturbations to block such attacks without affecting normal speech. Both methods demonstrate high success rates (89.8% activation, 98% blocking) across six smartphones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inaudible voice attacks suffer from limitations in cost, distance, or requiring line-of-sight. The paper aims to create an attack method that bypasses these constraints while developing an effective defense mechanism.

Method: 1)Analyzes solid-channel dispersion effects for long-range propagation
2)Designs a modular command generation model with attack distance, victim audio, and medium dispersion parameters
3)Develops SUAD Defense with time/frequency randomized ultrasonic perturbations modulated to inaudible frequencies

Result: SUAD Attack achieves 89.8% activation success on smartphones. SUAD Defense blocks inaudible voice attacks (IVAs) with 98% success rate while causing no interference with normal audio commands.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a new attack vector (SUAD Attack) that establishes long-range barriers-free inaudible voice command capabilities, and proposes SUAD Defense as an effective, non-intrusive defense mechanism against such attacks.

Abstract: As a versatile AI application, voice assistants (VAs) have become
increasingly popular, but are vulnerable to security threats. Attackers have
proposed various inaudible attacks, but are limited by cost, distance, or LoS.
Therefore, we propose \name~Attack, a long-range, cross-barrier, and
interference-free inaudible voice attack via solid channels. We begin by
thoroughly analyzing the dispersion effect in solid channels, revealing its
unique impact on signal propagation. To avoid distortions in voice commands, we
design a modular command generation model that parameterizes attack distance,
victim audio, and medium dispersion features to adapt to variations in the
solid-channel state. Additionally, we propose SUAD Defense, a universal defense
that uses ultrasonic perturbation signals to block inaudible voice attacks
(IVAs) without impacting normal speech. Since the attack can occur at arbitrary
frequencies and times, we propose a training method that randomizes both time
and frequency to generate perturbation signals that break ultrasonic commands.
Notably, the perturbation signal is modulated to an inaudible frequency without
affecting the functionality of voice commands for VAs. Experiments on six
smartphones have shown that SUAD Attack achieves activation success rates above
89.8% and SUAD Defense blocks IVAs with success rates exceeding 98%.

*Dingding Wang,Jianting He,Siwei Wu,Yajin Zhou,Lei Wu,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper studies smart contract upgrade insecurities by creating a large dataset of upgraded contracts and a taxonomy of 8 risk types from 37 real incidents, revealing 4 overlooked risks and 31,407 related issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on smart contract upgrades lacks comprehensive datasets and systematic identification of security risks, leading to unresolved gaps in understanding and mitigating upgrade-related insecurities.

Method: 1) Built a dataset of 83,085 upgraded contracts and 20,902 upgrade chains. 2) Developed a taxonomy based on 37 real-world incidents. 3) Conducted public awareness surveys and preliminary risk detection.

Result: 4 types of security risks are overlooked and lack mitigation; 31,407 upgrade-related issues detected, indicating significant real-world concerns.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical gaps in both disclosure and mitigation of upgrade risks, urging further attention to the identified overlooked risks and proposing the dataset as a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Smart contract upgrades are increasingly common due to their flexibility in
modifying deployed contracts, such as fixing bugs or adding new
functionalities. Meanwhile, upgrades compromise the immutability of contracts,
introducing significant security concerns. While existing research has explored
the security impacts of contract upgrades, these studies are limited in
collection of upgrade behaviors and identification of insecurities.
  To address these limitations, we conduct a comprehensive study on the
insecurities of upgrade behaviors. First, we build a dataset containing 83,085
upgraded contracts and 20,902 upgrade chains. To our knowledge, this is the
first large-scale dataset about upgrade behaviors, revealing their diversity
and exposing gaps in public disclosure. Next, we develop a taxonomy of
insecurities based on 37 real-world security incidents, categorizing eight
types of upgrade risks and providing the first complete view of upgrade-related
insecurities. Finally, we survey public awareness of these risks and existing
mitigations. Our findings show that four types of security risks are overlooked
by the public and lack mitigation measures. We detect these upgrade risks
through a preliminary study, identifying 31,407 related issues - a finding that
raises significant concerns.

### [56] [Whispering Agents: An event-driven covert communication protocol for the Internet of Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02188)
*Kaibo Huang,Yukun Wei,WanSheng Wu,Tianhua Zhang,Zhongliang Yang,Linna Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the vulnerability of communication acts in the Internet of Agents (IoA) by introducing the Covert Event Channel model and the PiCCAP protocol, which enable imperceptible, high-capacity covert communication through event-driven agent dialogues to enhance privacy against surveillance and traffic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Agent-to-Agent protocols secure message content but lack protections for the communication act itself, leaving agents vulnerable to sophisticated monitoring. Covert communication via event-driven dialogues is identified as an underexplored medium for privacy in distributed agent interactions.

Method: The paper formalizes the Covert Event Channel with three dimensions: (1) Storage, (2) Timing, and (3) Behavioral channels. It builds PiCCAP, a protocol operationalizing this model by leveraging event-driven timing, behavior, and message storage patterns to embed covert communications.

Result: Evaluation shows PiCCAP achieves robustness, high transmission capacity, and elusion of detection by advanced LLM-based wardens, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world implementation in sensitive agent communication spaces.

Conclusion: The structured engineering of covert event channels provides a foundational framework for developing future IoA monitoring systems and defensive protocols, enabling both proactive privacy measures and intelligent threat detection in agent interactions.

Abstract: The emergence of the Internet of Agents (IoA) introduces critical challenges
for communication privacy in sensitive, high-stakes domains. While standard
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols secure message content, they are not designed to
protect the act of communication itself, leaving agents vulnerable to
surveillance and traffic analysis. We find that the rich, event-driven nature
of agent dialogues provides a powerful, yet untapped, medium for covert
communication. To harness this potential, we introduce and formalize the Covert
Event Channel, the first unified model for agent covert communication driven by
three interconnected dimensions, which consist of the Storage, Timing,and
Behavioral channels. Based on this model, we design and engineer {\Pi}CCAP, a
novel protocol that operationalizes this event-driven paradigm. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that {\Pi}CCAP achieves high capacity and
robustness while remaining imperceptible to powerful LLM-based wardens,
establishing its practical viability. By systematically engineering this
channel, our work provides the foundational understanding essential for
developing the next generation of monitoring systems and defensive protocols
for a secure and trustworthy IoA.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines data security risks in large language models (LLMs) and reviews defense strategies, datasets, and future research directions to promote safe development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs increasingly power critical systems but face vulnerabilities from uncurated training data, necessitating robust security solutions to maintain trust and reliability.

Method: Comprehensive survey of data security risks, analysis of defense approaches like adversarial training and RLHF, and categorization of datasets used for security evaluation.

Result: Catalogs security risks (toxic outputs, hallucinations, prompt injection), summarizes existing defenses and datasets, and identifies research gaps in secure updates and governance.

Conclusion: The work provides guidance for researchers and policymakers to address data-centric security challenges and ensure responsible advancement of LLM technology.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), now a foundation in advancing natural language
processing, power applications such as text generation, machine translation,
and conversational systems. Despite their transformative potential, these
models inherently rely on massive amounts of training data, often collected
from diverse and uncurated sources, which exposes them to serious data security
risks. Harmful or malicious data can compromise model behavior, leading to
issues such as toxic output, hallucinations, and vulnerabilities to threats
such as prompt injection or data poisoning. As LLMs continue to be integrated
into critical real-world systems, understanding and addressing these
data-centric security risks is imperative to safeguard user trust and system
reliability. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the main data
security risks facing LLMs and reviews current defense strategies, including
adversarial training, RLHF, and data augmentation. Additionally, we categorize
and analyze relevant datasets used for assessing robustness and security across
different domains, providing guidance for future research. Finally, we
highlight key research directions that focus on secure model updates,
explainability-driven defenses, and effective governance frameworks, aiming to
promote the safe and responsible development of LLM technology. This work aims
to inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, driving progress toward
data security in LLMs.

### [58] [Analysis of Publicly Accessible Operational Technology and Associated Risks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02375)
*Matthew Rodda,Vasilios Mavroudis*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper highlights security vulnerabilities in internet-exposed Operational Technology (OT) systems across industries, identifying 70,000 devices with outdated firmware and unpatched critical flaws, while demonstrating pathways for unauthorized access via exposed HMIs/SCADA systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OT systems in critical infrastructure (energy, manufacturing, transportation) have historically prioritized functionality over security, creating risks when operational misconfigurations leave them exposed to the internet.

Method: The study conducted a global analysis of OT threat landscapes by examining exposed protocols (ModbusTCP, EtherNet/IP, S7), vendors, software, and geographic distribution. Automated screenshot analysis was used to detect publicly accessible graphical interfaces of HMIs and SCADA systems.

Result: 70,000 OT devices (primarily in North America/Europe) were found exposed, with many revealing unpatched firmware vulnerabilities. Automated analysis identified thousands of exposed HMI/SCADA interfaces, showcasing diverse unauthorized access pathways.

Conclusion: The unaddressed vulnerabilities in internet-exposed OT systems represent a critical threat to industrial operations and national infrastructure, necessitating urgent mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Operational Technology (OT) is an integral component of critical national
infrastructure, enabling automation and control in industries such as energy,
manufacturing, and transportation. However, OT networks, systems, and devices
have been designed and deployed prioritising functionality rather than
security. This leads to inherent vulnerabilities in many deployed systems when
operational misconfigurations expose them to the internet. This report provides
an up-to-date overview of the OT threat landscape exposed to the public
internet and studies the affected protocols, vendors, software, and the
geographic distribution of systems. Our findings reveal nearly 70,000 exposed
OT devices globally, with significant concentrations in North America and
Europe. Analysis of prevalent protocols (e.g., ModbusTCP, EtherNet/IP, S7)
shows that many devices expose detailed identifying information, including
outdated firmware versions with known critical vulnerabilities that remain
unpatched for years after disclosure. Furthermore, we demonstrate how automated
analysis of screenshots can uncover exposed graphical interfaces of Human
Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
systems, highlighting diverse pathways for potential unauthorized access and
underscoring the risks to industrial processes and critical infrastructure.

Result: Secure, hardware-free authentication for a broader range of devices (including legacy and cloud-based systems) within blockchain networks while mitigating common attacks.

Conclusion: The combined use of SoftPUF and blockchain-based security mechanisms enables scalable, efficient, and hardware-independent authentication for diverse blockchain applications.

Abstract: Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) offers a secure and lightweight
alternative to traditional cryptography for authentication due to their unique
device fingerprint. However, their dependence on specialized hardware hinders
their adoption in diverse applications. This paper proposes a novel blockchain
framework that leverages SoftPUF, a software-based approach mimicking PUF.
SoftPUF addresses the hardware limitations of traditional PUF, enabling secure
and efficient authentication for a broader range of devices within a blockchain
network. The framework utilizes a machine learning model trained on PUF data to
generate unique, software-based keys for each device. These keys serve as
secure identifiers for authentication on the blockchain, eliminating the need
for dedicated hardware. This approach facilitates the integration of legacy
devices from various domains, including cloud-based solutions, into the
blockchain network. Additionally, the framework incorporates well-established
defense mechanisms to ensure robust security against various attacks. This
combined approach paves the way for secure and scalable authentication in
diverse blockchain-based applications. Additionally, to ensure robust security,
the system incorporates well-established defense mechanisms against various
attacks, including 51%, phishing, routing, and Sybil attacks, into the
blockchain network. This combined approach paves the way for secure and
efficient authentication in a wider range of blockchain-based applications.

*Malvika Jadhav,Wenxuan Bao,Vincent Bindschaedler*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper systematically analyzes recent Android stalkerware apps to assess how platform privacy updates impact their functionality and adaptation, proposing alternative defense strategies beyond detection/removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stalkerware research focuses on detection/removal approaches that may be ineffective due to the persistent and evolving nature of these threats.

Method: Combined analysis of a large corpus of Android stalkerware apps using multiple techniques to quantify behaviors, capabilities, and temporal evolution of their tactics.

Result: Identified stalkerware adaptations to Android privacy changes and provided insights into their evolving strategies for maintaining functionality.

Conclusion: Android privacy improvements partially thwart stalkerware but necessitate new defensive approaches; understanding these adaptations can inform more effective privacy protections.

Abstract: Stalkerware is a serious threat to individuals' privacy that is receiving
increased attention from the security and privacy research communities.
Existing works have largely focused on studying leading stalkerware apps,
dual-purpose apps, monetization of stalkerware, or the experience of survivors.
However, there remains a need to understand potential defenses beyond the
detection-and-removal approach, which may not necessarily be effective in the
context of stalkerware.
  In this paper, we perform a systematic analysis of a large corpus of recent
Android stalkerware apps. We combine multiple analysis techniques to quantify
stalkerware behaviors and capabilities and how these evolved over time. Our
primary goal is understanding: how (and whether) recent Android platform
changes -- largely designed to improve user privacy -- have thwarted
stalkerware functionality; how stalkerware may have adapted as a result; and
what we may conclude about potential defenses. Our investigation reveals new
insights into tactics used by stalkerware and may inspire alternative defense
strategies.

*Abdullah Al Mamun,Kyle Yates,Antsa Rakotondrafara,Mashrur Chowdhury,Ryann Cartor,Shuhong Gao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates three post-quantum HE schemes (BFV, BGV, CKKS) for ITS privacy in real-world V2X scenarios, showing their feasibility for encrypted data processing with latency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ITS requires vehicle data for operations like congestion monitoring but faces privacy challenges. HE enables computation on encrypted data, with post-quantum schemes being critical for future security.

Method: The authors experimentally assess BFV, BGV, and CKKS in two privacy-preserving ITS use cases (encrypted vehicle counting and average speed aggregation) across Wi-Fi and Ethernet networks.

Result: BFV/BGV achieved <10s latency for latency-tolerant ITS tasks, CKKS showed higher overhead but viability for periodic numerical aggregation, demonstrating HE's feasibility under 128-bit post-quantum security.

Conclusion: HE can be practically deployed in ITS for secure V2X data processing if scheme-specific latency constraints are met, solidifying its role as a post-quantum privacy preservation foundation.

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) fundamentally rely on
vehicle-generated data for applications such as congestion monitoring and route
optimization, making the preservation of user privacy a critical challenge.
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) offers a promising solution by enabling computation
on encrypted data without revealing underlying content. This study presents the
first real-world experimental evaluation of three post-quantum secure HE
schemes, i.e., Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV), Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan
(BGV), and Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS), for vehicular communication scenarios.
Two representative privacy-preserving use cases are considered: encrypted
vehicle counting and average speed aggregation. Experiments are conducted over
both Wi-Fi and Ethernet to assess performance under wireless and wired
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) settings. Results show that BFV and BGV are
suitable for latency-tolerant applications such as intersection monitoring and
regional traffic analysis, with total end-to-end latencies under 10 seconds.
While CKKS experiences higher overhead, it remains viable for periodic
encrypted aggregation of numerical data. The experimental results demonstrate
that HE can be feasibly deployed in ITS environments under 128-bit post-quantum
security, provided that scheme-specific latency constraints are considered.
This reinforces its potential to serve as a foundational tool for secure and
privacy-preserving V2X data processing.

*Kongxin Wang,Jie Zhang,Peigui Qi,Kunsheng Tang,Tianwei Zhang,Wenbo Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PoseGuard is a safety alignment framework for pose-guided video generation that degrades output quality for malicious poses while preserving high-fidelity outputs for benign inputs, ensuring ethical and secure generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose-guided video generation risks malicious misuse through impersonation, privacy violations, and NSFW content creation, necessitating safeguards for safe deployment.

Method: Dual-objective training combining generation fidelity (e.g., LoRA fine-tuning) and safety alignment, with pose-specific LoRA fusion to adaptively suppress unsafe generations (three categories: discriminatory gestures, NSFW poses, and copyrighted imitations).

Result: Experiments show PoseGuard effectively blocks unsafe generations, maintains benign input quality, and remains robust to pose variations, with generalizability to facial landmark-guided generation demonstrated.

Conclusion: PoseGuard provides an efficient, modular safety solution for pose-guided generation through parameter-light fine-tuning, balancing ethical alignment and output quality.

Abstract: Pose-guided video generation has become a powerful tool in creative
industries, exemplified by frameworks like Animate Anyone. However,
conditioning generation on specific poses introduces serious risks, such as
impersonation, privacy violations, and NSFW content creation. To address these
challenges, we propose $\textbf{PoseGuard}$, a safety alignment framework for
pose-guided generation. PoseGuard is designed to suppress unsafe generations by
degrading output quality when encountering malicious poses, while maintaining
high-fidelity outputs for benign inputs. We categorize unsafe poses into three
representative types: discriminatory gestures such as kneeling or offensive
salutes, sexually suggestive poses that lead to NSFW content, and poses
imitating copyrighted celebrity movements. PoseGuard employs a dual-objective
training strategy combining generation fidelity with safety alignment, and uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning for efficient, parameter-light updates. To ensure
adaptability to evolving threats, PoseGuard supports pose-specific LoRA fusion,
enabling flexible and modular updates when new unsafe poses are identified. We
further demonstrate the generalizability of PoseGuard to facial landmark-guided
generation. Extensive experiments validate that PoseGuard effectively blocks
unsafe generations, maintains generation quality for benign inputs, and remains
robust against slight pose variations.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an LLM-based approach to extract and classify transportation-related cyber incidents from public datasets into structured databases, while developing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) QA system to improve accessibility and cybersecurity awareness in the sector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Citing 95% of data breaches as human error-driven and noting the scarcity of centralized records for transportation cyberattacks, the study emphasizes the urgent need to enhance cybersecurity awareness and actionable incident data accessibility in transportation systems.

Method: The authors fine-tuned large language models to categorize cyber incidents into five transportation modes (aviation, maritime, rail, road, multimodal) from heterogeneous datasets across six public repositories. They also implemented a RAG-based question answering system for database interaction.

Result: A transportation-specific cyber incident database was successfully created by classifying 2018-2022 incidents from CSIS, UMCED, EuRepoC, MCAD, and TraCR datasets. The RAG QA system demonstrated practical utility in enabling targeted queries across the curated database.

Conclusion: The work establishes an innovative framework for transforming fragmented cyber incident data into a transport-sector database using generative AI, with the RAG system significantly improving data usability for cybersecurity awareness. This approach provides a scalable solution for incident monitoring and preparedness in critical transportation infrastructure.

Abstract: Technological advancements have revolutionized numerous industries, including
transportation. While digitalization, automation, and connectivity have
enhanced safety and efficiency, they have also introduced new vulnerabilities.
With 95% of data breaches attributed to human error, promoting cybersecurity
awareness in transportation is increasingly critical. Despite numerous
cyberattacks on transportation systems worldwide, comprehensive and centralized
records of these incidents remain scarce. To address this gap and enhance cyber
awareness, this paper presents a large language model (LLM) based approach to
extract and organize transportation related cyber incidents from publicly
available datasets. A key contribution of this work is the use of generative AI
to transform unstructured, heterogeneous cyber incident data into structured
formats. Incidents were sourced from the Center for Strategic & International
Studies (CSIS) List of Significant Cyber Incidents, the University of Maryland
Cyber Events Database (UMCED), the European Repository of Cyber Incidents
(EuRepoC), the Maritime Cyber Attack Database (MCAD), and the U.S. DOT
Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency (TraCR) Examples of Cyber Attacks
in Transportation (2018 to 2022). These were classified by a fine tuned LLM
into five transportation modes: aviation, maritime, rail, road, and multimodal,
forming a transportation specific cyber incident database. Another key
contribution of this work is the development of a Retrieval Augmented
Generation question answering system, designed to enhance accessibility and
practical use by enabling users to query the curated database for specific
details on transportation related cyber incidents. By leveraging LLMs for both
data extraction and user interaction, this study contributes a novel,
accessible tool for improving cybersecurity awareness in the transportation
sector.

*Guillaume Quispe,Pierre Jouvelot,Gerard Memmi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Nicknames for Group Signatures (NGS) integrates SFPK into GS to enable auditable anonymous transfers, demonstrated through the NickHat prototype on Ethereum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing group signatures lack flexible public keys for anonymous yet auditable transfers, necessitating a system where third parties can securely trace transactions without compromising privacy

Method: mathematically constructs NGS by combining group signature anonymity with SFPK's flexible key generation, formalizing its security model within Random Oracle Model assumptions

Result: successfully implemented NickHat (blockchain-based token-exchange system) that maintains message anonymity while preserving auditability for authorized parties

Conclusion: NGS establishes a robust balance between user privacy and transfer accountability, proving its practical viability through Ethereum-based deployment

Abstract: Nicknames for Group Signatures (NGS) is a new signature scheme that extends
Group Signatures (GS) with Signatures with Flexible Public Keys (SFPK). Via GS,
each member of a group can sign messages on behalf of the group without
revealing his identity, except to a designated auditor. Via SFPK, anyone can
create new identities for a particular user, enabling anonymous transfers with
only the intended recipient able to trace these new identities.
  To prevent the potential abuses that this anonymity brings, NGS integrates
flexible public keys into the GS framework to support auditable transfers. In
addition to introducing NGS, we describe its security model and provide a
mathematical construction proved secure in the Random Oracle Model. As a
practical NGS use case, we build NickHat, a blockchain-based token-exchange
prototype system on top of Ethereum.

*Shafizur Rahman Seeam,Ye Zheng,Zhengxiong Li,Yidan Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PrivAR is a client-side framework for real-time location-based AR applications that addresses privacy risks through two lightweight mechanisms (PSM and TR-PSM), achieving 50% better QoS and 1.8x higher attacker error with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-frequency location reporting in LB-AR introduces serious privacy risks due to real-time immersion demands, creating a unique challenge for privacy solutions to balance strong per-location/trajectory protection with low latency and high QoS.

Method: 1) Planar Staircase Mechanism (PSM): Staircase-shaped noise generation with expected error control
2) Thresholded Reporting with PSM (TR-PSM): Selective location updates only when displacement exceeds private thresholds
Combines differential privacy principles with many-to-one mapping strategies.

Result: • 50% improvement in QoS (GameScore) over alternatives
• 1.8x increase in attacker error
• 0.06ms runtime overhead on Pokémon Go-style prototype
• Validated through theoretical analysis, public datasets, and proprietary GeoTrace dataset experiments

Conclusion: PrivAR successfully addresses the real-time privacy-QoS tradeoff in LB-AR applications by innovating both per-location and trajectory-level privacy protection, demonstrated through empirical validation on commercial benchmarks.

Abstract: Location-based augmented reality (LB-AR) applications, such as Pok\'emon Go,
stream sub-second GPS updates to deliver responsive and immersive user
experiences. However, this high-frequency location reporting introduces serious
privacy risks. Protecting privacy in LB-AR is significantly more challenging
than in traditional location-based services (LBS), as it demands real-time
location protection with strong per-location and trajectory-level privacy
guaranteed while maintaining low latency and high quality of service (QoS).
Existing methods fail to meet these combined demands.
  To fill the gap, we present PrivAR, the first client-side privacy framework
for real-time LB-AR. PrivAR introduces two lightweight mechanisms: (i) Planar
Staircase Mechanism (PSM) which designs a staircase-shaped distribution to
generate noisy location with strong per-location privacy and low expected
error; and (ii) Thresholded Reporting with PSM (TR-PSM), a selective scheme
that releases a noisy location update only when a displacement exceeds a
private threshold, enabling many-to-one mappings for enhanced trace-level
privacy while preserving high QoS. We present theoretical analysis, extensive
experiments on two public datasets and our proprietary GeoTrace dataset, and
validate PrivAR on a Pok\'emon-Go-style prototype. Results show PrivAR improves
QoS (Gamescore) by up to 50%, while increasing attacker error by 1.8x over
baseline with an additional 0.06 milliseconds runtime overhead.

### [66] [TestWeaver: Execution-aware, Feedback-driven Regression Testing Generation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01255)
*Cuong Chi Le,Cuong Duc Van,Tung Duy Vu,Thai Minh Pham Vu,Hoang Nhat Phan,Huy Nhat Phan,Tien N. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TestWeaver is an LLM-based regression testing approach that combines lightweight program analysis to overcome coverage plateaus through three innovations: focusing LLM context with backward slices, incorporating similar test cases, and injecting execution annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent LLM-based test generation suffers from limited execution reasoning and coverage stagnation, termed the 'coverage plateau', due to untargeted exploration and contextual limitations.

Method: 1) Uses backward slices instead of full program context to reduce hallucinations 2) Identifies control-flow similar 'close test cases' to enrich context within the LLM window 3) Injects variable state comments (execution annotations) along execution paths via runtime analysis.

Result: TestWeaver achieves faster coverage growth rates and generates more effective regression test cases compared to other LLM-based approaches through its targeted input strategy.

Conclusion: By contextualizing LLM inputs with program analysis artifacts, TestWeaver enables more effective and efficient regression testing that overcomes coverage plateaus through focused generation and reduced redundant path exploration.

Abstract: Regression testing ensures that code changes do not unintentionally break
existing functionality. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have shown promise in automating test generation for regression testing, they
often suffer from limited reasoning about program execution, resulting in
stagnated coverage growth - a phenomenon known as the coverage plateau. In this
paper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates
lightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively.
TestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and
improves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target
line instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close
test cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the
target line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and
(3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode
variable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these
targeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test
generation and mitigates redundant explorations. Empirical results demonstrate
that TestWeaver accelerates code coverage growth and generates more effective
regression test cases than existing LLM-based approaches.

### [67] [Screencast-Based Analysis of User-Perceived GUI Responsiveness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01337)
*Wei Liu,Linqiang Guo,Yi Wen Heng,Chenglin Li,Tse-Hsun,Chen,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight black-box tool (	ool) that measures mobile GUI responsiveness through screencast analysis, achieving high accuracy in detecting user interactions (96% precision, 93% recall) and outperforming traditional methods in industrial application testing pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GUI responsiveness analysis using static analysis or system metrics fails to scale effectively in industrial settings evaluating thousands of apps across diverse devices/OS versions, and cannot accurately capture user-perceived delays crucial for user experience.

Method: The tool uses computer vision to detect user interactions and analyze frame-level visual changes in mobile screencasts. It calculates two metrics: response time (user action to first feedback) and finish time (until visual stabilization), operating as a black-box solution without requiring app internals.

Result: Evaluates on a 2,458 interaction benchmark (64 Android apps) showing 96% precision/93% recall for interaction detection, with 50ms/100ms error margins for response/finish times in 89% of cases. Industrial deployment revealed issues missed by existing tools and improved debugging efficiency.

Conclusion: Screencast-based analysis enables more accurate user-perceived responsiveness evaluation, demonstrating practical effectiveness in large-scale testing pipelines while addressing scalability limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: GUI responsiveness is critical for a positive user experience in mobile
applications. Even brief delays in visual feedback can frustrate users and lead
to negative reviews. However, detecting and quantifying such user-perceived
delays remains challenging, especially in industrial testing pipelines that
evaluate thousands of apps daily across diverse devices and OS versions.
Existing techniques based on static analysis or system metrics, while useful,
may not accurately capture user-perceived issues or scale effectively.
  In this experience paper, we present \tool, a lightweight and black-box
technique that measures GUI responsiveness directly from mobile screencasts --
video recordings captured during automated GUI testing. \tool detects user
interactions and visual delays, helping developers identify GUI performance
issues that affect the user experience. It uses computer vision to detect user
interactions and analyzes frame-level visual changes to compute two key
metrics: response time (from user action to first visual feedback) and finish
time (until visual feedback stabilizes). We evaluate \tool on a manually
annotated benchmark of 2,458 interactions from 64 popular Android apps. \tool
achieves 0.96 precision and 0.93 recall in detecting interactions, and measures
response and finish times within 50\,ms and 100\,ms error, respectively, for
over 89\% of interactions. The tool has been deployed in an industrial testing
pipeline and analyzes thousands of screencasts daily, uncovering responsiveness
issues missed by traditional tools and improving performance debugging
efficiency.

### [68] [HyClone: Bridging LLM Understanding and Dynamic Execution for Semantic Code Clone Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01357)
*Yunhao Liang,Ruixuan Ying,Takuya Taniguchi,Guwen Lyu,Zhe Cui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A two-stage framework combining LLM-based screening and execution-based validation for improved semantic clone detection in Python.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional code clone detection methods struggle with semantic clones (Type 4) due to reliance on syntax, while direct LLM approaches remain suboptimal from their syntactic sensitivity.

Method: Stage 1: LLM evaluates code pairs to filter non-clones via semantic analysis. Stage 2: Uses LLM-generated test inputs and cross-execution validation to confirm functional equivalence for candidate clones.

Result: Significant precision, recall, and F1-score improvements over direct LLM-based detection were achieved in experiments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses semantic clone detection challenges, but cross-language detection and large-scale implementation optimization remain open research directions.

Abstract: Code clone detection is a critical task in software engineering, aimed at
identifying duplicated or similar code fragments within or across software
systems. Traditional methods often fail to capture functional equivalence,
particularly for semantic clones (Type 4), where code fragments implement
identical functionality despite differing syntactic structures. Recent advances
in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding code
semantics. However, directly applying LLMs to code clone detection yields
suboptimal results due to their sensitivity to syntactic differences. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines
LLM-based screening with execution-based validation for detecting semantic
clones in Python programs. In the first stage, an LLM evaluates code pairs to
filter out obvious non-clones based on semantic analysis. For pairs not
identified as clones, the second stage employs an execution-based validation
approach, utilizing LLM-generated test inputs to assess functional equivalence
through cross-execution validation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates
significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to direct
LLM-based detection, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in identifying
semantic clones. Future work includes exploring cross-language clone detection
and optimizing the framework for large-scale applications.

### [69] [An Empirical Validation of Open Source Repository Stability Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01358)
*Elijah Kayode Adejumo,Brittany Johnson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper empirically validates the Composite Stability Index (CSI) for open source software using 100 GitHub repositories, finding weekly commit sampling and median-based statistical inferences yield more accurate stability metrics, and provides data-driven parameters for project monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open source software's critical role in global supply chains requires reliable methods to measure its intrinsic stability and sustainability potential. The proposed control theory framework lacked empirical validation despite its theoretical foundations.

Method: We tested the CSI framework by analyzing 100 high-ranked GitHub repositories, comparing daily vs. weekly commit frequency patterns and evaluating effectiveness of mean vs. median calculations for issue/pull request resolution metrics, while incorporating community engagement data.

Result: 1) Weekly commit frequency provides better stability measurements across repositories 2) Using median instead of mean improves statistical inferences for resolution/review time indices 3) Data-driven half-width parameters revealed better alignment between stability scores and real project behavior.

Conclusion: These findings both confirm the control theory approach's practical value for assessing open source health and establish evidence-based improvements for implementing the CSI in real-world monitoring tools.

Abstract: Over the past few decades, open source software has been continuously
integrated into software supply chains worldwide, drastically increasing
reliance and dependence. Because of the role this software plays, it is
important to understand ways to measure and promote its stability and potential
for sustainability. Recent work proposed the use of control theory to
understand repository stability and evaluate repositories' ability to return to
equilibrium after a disturbance such as the introduction of a new feature
request, a spike in bug reports, or even the influx or departure of
contributors. This approach leverages commit frequency patterns, issue
resolution rate, pull request merge rate, and community activity engagement to
provide a Composite Stability Index (CSI). While this framework has theoretical
foundations, there is no empirical validation of the CSI in practice. In this
paper, we present the first empirical validation of the proposed CSI by
experimenting with 100 highly ranked GitHub repositories. Our results suggest
that (1) sampling weekly commit frequency pattern instead of daily is a more
feasible measure of commit frequency stability across repositories and (2)
improved statistical inferences (swapping mean with median), particularly with
ascertaining resolution and review times in issues and pull request, improves
the overall issue and pull request stability index. Drawing on our empirical
dataset, we also derive data-driven half-width parameters that better align
stability scores with real project behavior. These findings both confirm the
viability of a control-theoretic lens on open-source health and provide
concrete, evidence-backed applications for real-world project monitoring tools.

### [70] [From Technical Excellence to Practical Adoption: Lessons Learned Building an ML-Enhanced Trace Analysis Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01430)
*Kaveh Shahedi,Matthew Khouzam,Heng Li,Maxime Lamothe,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TMLL addresses the 'Excellence Paradox' in software trace analysis by prioritizing usability, trust, and integration. Survey and industry validation show 77.5% prioritize result quality/trust over sophistication, and 67.5% prefer semi-automated analysis with control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify barriers to adoption of sophisticated trace analysis tools in industry and challenge assumptions that technical excellence alone ensures usability.

Method: 12-month collaboration with Ericsson Montréal (TMLL development), followed by validation through expert feedback, Eclipse Foundation integration, and a mixed-methods survey of 40 professionals combining quantitative data with qualitative analysis from industrial practice.

Result: 77.5% of professionals prioritize trust/simplicity over sophistication; 67.5% prefer semi-automation with user control; TMLL validates three adoption principles (cognitive compatibility, embedded expertise, transparency-based trust) via practical implementation and peer review.

Conclusion: Sustainable tool adoption requires adoption-centered design over capability-focused development, emphasizing cognitive compatibility and transparency for practitioner trust in automated software engineering.

Abstract: System tracing has become essential for understanding complex software
behavior in modern systems, yet sophisticated trace analysis tools face
significant adoption gaps in industrial settings. Through a year-long
collaboration with Ericsson Montr\'eal, developing TMLL (Trace-Server Machine
Learning Library, now in the Eclipse Foundation), we investigated barriers to
trace analysis adoption. Contrary to assumptions about complexity or automation
needs, practitioners struggled with translating expert knowledge into
actionable insights, integrating analysis into their workflows, and trusting
automated results they could not validate. We identified what we called the
Excellence Paradox: technical excellence can actively impede adoption when
conflicting with usability, transparency, and practitioner trust. TMLL
addresses this through adoption-focused design that embeds expert knowledge in
interfaces, provides transparent explanations, and enables incremental
adoption. Validation through Ericsson's experts' feedback, Eclipse Foundation's
integration, and a survey of 40 industry and academic professionals revealed
consistent patterns: survey results showed that 77.5% prioritize quality and
trust in results over technical sophistication, while 67.5% prefer
semi-automated analysis with user control, findings supported by qualitative
feedback from industrial collaboration and external peer review. Results
validate three core principles: cognitive compatibility, embedded expertise,
and transparency-based trust. This challenges conventional capability-focused
tool development, demonstrating that sustainable adoption requires
reorientation toward adoption-focused design with actionable implications for
automated software engineering tools.

### [71] [Tuning LLM-based Code Optimization via Meta-Prompting: An Industrial Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01443)
*Jingzhi Gong,Rafail Giavrimis,Paul Brookes,Vardan Voskanyan,Fan Wu,Mari Ashiga,Matthew Truscott,Mike Basios,Leslie Kanthan,Jie Xu,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MPCO introduces a meta-prompting framework to automate cross-model code optimization across multiple LLMs, achieving 19.06% performance improvements and demonstrating effective context integration on the ARTEMIS platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial platforms with multiple LLMs face significant challenges as model-specific prompt engineering limits practical adoption of multi-LLM optimization systems. Current prompt optimization methods lack cross-model effectiveness, requiring tedious manual adjustments between different LLM architectures.

Method: The framework employs meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by combining three components: project metadata (code structure, dependencies), task requirements (optimization goals), and LLM-specific contexts (model strengths/weaknesses). It integrates with the ARTEMIS platform for automated validation and scale-able deployment.

Result: Evaluated on five real-world codebases (366h benchmarks), MPCO shows 19.06% max performance improvement with best statistical rank against baselines. 96% of top optimizations result from meaningful edits. Ablation studies confirm context integration's critical role, while meta-prompter analysis reveals all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters.

Conclusion: MPCO provides a scalable solution for industrial multi-LLM code optimization by demonstrating both cross-model effectiveness and practical efficiency gains. The study's sensitivity analysis establishes universal utility of major LLMs for meta-prompting and emphasizes that comprehensive context integration is key to successful automation in industrial contexts.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple
LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with
others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model
prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of
multi-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we
introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that
automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs
while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages
meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by
integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and
it seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated
validation and scaling.
  Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of
runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall
performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all
systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the
top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic
ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that
comprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting,
and that all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters,
providing actionable insights for industrial practitioners.

### [72] [Directed Grammar-Based Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01472)
*Lukas Kirschner,Ezekiel Soremekun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FdLoop is an automated test generation approach that iteratively learns input properties via test feedback and probabilistic grammar, outperforming existing methods in 86% settings for goal-specific testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test generators, especially grammar-based ones, struggle to create inputs targeting specific testing goals like code coverage or error induction.

Method: FdLoop iteratively selects, evolves, and learns input distributions using test feedback and a probabilistic grammar to generate goal-specific test inputs.

Result: FdLoop outperforms five baselines (including EvoGFuzz) in 86% of scenarios across three input formats and 20 software projects, achieving 2X higher effectiveness in inducing erroneous behaviors. Its core components show positive contributions.

Conclusion: FdLoop effectively achieves diverse testing goals (e.g., error induction, code coverage) and scales to multi-goal testing. Its iterative learning approach and component synergy improve test generation effectiveness.

Abstract: To effectively test complex software, it is important to generate
goal-specific inputs, i.e., inputs that achieve a specific testing goal.
However, most state-of-the-art test generators are not designed to target
specific goals. Notably, grammar-based test generators, which (randomly)
produce syntactically valid inputs via an input specification (i.e., grammar)
have a low probability of achieving an arbitrary testing goal. This work
addresses this challenge by proposing an automated test generation approach
(called FdLoop) which iteratively learns relevant input properties from
existing inputs to drive the generation of goal-specific inputs. Given a
testing goal, FdLoop iteratively selects, evolves and learn the input
distribution of goal-specific test inputs via test feedback and a probabilistic
grammar. We concretize FdLoop for four testing goals, namely unique code
coverage, input-to-code complexity, program failures (exceptions) and long
execution time. We evaluate FdLoop using three (3) well-known input formats
(JSON, CSS and JavaScript) and 20 open-source software. In most (86%) settings,
FdLoop outperforms all five tested baselines namely the baseline grammar-based
test generators (random, probabilistic and inverse-probabilistic methods),
EvoGFuzz and DynaMosa. FdLoop is (up to) twice (2X) as effective as the best
baseline (EvoGFuzz) in inducing erroneous behaviors. In addition, we show that
the main components of FdLoop (i.e., input mutator, grammar mutator and test
feedbacks) contribute positively to its effectiveness. Finally, our evaluation
demonstrates that FdLoop effectively achieves single testing goals (revealing
erroneous behaviors, generating complex inputs, or inducing long execution
time) and scales to multiple testing goals across varying parameter settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the disconnect between academic research on software automation and industry practices, particularly in the context of GitHub's central role in the OSS ecosystem.

Method: The paper conducts a comparative analysis of GitHub Marketplace tools and academic literature, employing systematic methods to identify trends and alignment gaps.

Result: The analysis reveals distinct trends in industry automation tools versus academic advancements, highlighting potential areas for academic contributions to practical innovation.

Abstract: GitHub, a central hub for collaborative software development, has
revolutionized the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem through its GitHub
Marketplace, a platform launched in 2017 to host automation tools aimed at
enhancing the efficiency and scalability of software projects. As the adoption
of automation in OSS production grows, understanding the trends,

*Angel C. Chavez-Moreno,Cristina L. Abad*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: OpenLambdaVerse is a dataset and analysis tool created by filtering GitHub repositories using the Serverless Framework and AWS Lambda, offering insights into modern serverless computing trends and security practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for updated, real-world data on serverless computing practices arises from the rapidly evolving ecosystem, requiring better understanding for both researchers and developers.

Method: Dataset creation via GitHub repository filtering using Wonderless methodologies with added steps, followed by characterization of application size, complexity, language usage, triggers, maturity, and security practices.

Result: Identified trends in serverless workloads including dominant languages, triggers, project maturity, and security vulnerabilities, revealing current ecosystem patterns.

Conclusion: OpenLambdaVerse provides a valuable, up-to-date resource for understanding serverless architecture evolution, with implications for development practices and research directions.

Abstract: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is at the core of serverless computing, enabling
developers to easily deploy applications without managing computing resources.
With an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach, frameworks like the Serverless
Framework use YAML configurations to define and deploy APIs, tasks, workflows,
and event-driven applications on cloud providers, promoting zero-friction
development. As with any rapidly evolving ecosystem, there is a need for
updated insights into how these tools are used in real-world projects. Building
on the methodology established by the Wonderless dataset for serverless
computing (and applying multiple new filtering steps), OpenLambdaVerse
addresses this gap by creating a dataset of current GitHub repositories that
use the Serverless Framework in applications that contain one or more AWS
Lambda functions. We then analyze and characterize this dataset to get an
understanding of the state-of-the-art in serverless architectures based on this
stack. Through this analysis we gain important insights on the size and
complexity of current applications, which languages and runtimes they employ,
how are the functions triggered, the maturity of the projects, and their
security practices (or lack of). OpenLambdaVerse thus offers a valuable,
up-to-date resource for both practitioners and researchers that seek to better
understand evolving serverless workloads.

### [75] [Exploring Direct Instruction and Summary-Mediated Prompting in LLM-Assisted Code Modification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01523)
*Ningzhi Tang,Emory Smith,Yu Huang,Collin McMillan,Toby Jia-Jun Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how large language models (LLMs) support code modification via direct instruction vs. summary-mediated prompting, revealing developer workflow patterns and strategy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel in code generation, their effectiveness for code modification remains underexplored, and effective prompting strategies for modification differ from generation.

Method: Conducted an exploratory study with 15 developers completing modification tasks using both direct instruction prompting (explicit free-form language instructions) and summary-mediated prompting (editing generated code summaries) across multiple scenarios.

Result: Developers adopted an iterative workflow involving code understanding, edit localization, and validation. Direct instruction offered flexibility, while summary-mediated aided comprehension and control. Factor influencing strategy choice included task urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and code familiarity.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted code modification requires improved prompting interfaces with adjustable summary granularity, reliable traceability between summaries/code, and consistent summary generation to better support developer workflows.

Abstract: This paper presents a study of using large language models (LLMs) in
modifying existing code. While LLMs for generating code have been widely
studied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although
"prompting" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate
intents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification
introduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that
natural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches
have been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study
investigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:
Direct Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in
free-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by
editing the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study
with 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques
across multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an
iterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating
outputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy
presented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier
to specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt
scaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task
goals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and
code familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt
interactions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summary-code
traceability, and consistency in generated summaries.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RepoForge is an autonomous end-to-end pipeline that solves software engineering LLM training bottlenecks (costly infrastructure, limited data, inefficient evaluation). It achieves 17.4% on SWE-Bench-Verified with 8B models, auto-generates 7,304 executable environments, reduces storage by 14×, speeds evaluation by 70%, and cuts labeling costs by 19,000× using techniques like Ray-powered harnesses, dependency management, and SPICE-based automated labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training SWE LLMs faces challenges in infrastructure costs, sequential evaluation pipelines, scarce high-quality training data, manual labeling expenses, and multi-turn RL bottlenecks. This work aims to create a scalable, cost-effective training framework through automation and optimization.

Method: 1. Auto-generates environments from GitHub commits using intelligent dependency management and image pruning for storage efficiency. 2. Implements Ray-powered distributed evaluation harness. 3. Uses SPICE-based automated labeling to reduce manual effort. 4. Integrates a bubble-free RL scaffold and unified abstractions for training agents. 5. Combines sandboxing, data generation, and reward pipelines into an end-to-end system.

Result: RepoForge-8B-Agent establishes new SOTA (17.4%) on SWE-Bench-Verified. Achieved 7,304 automatic environments, 14× storage reduction, >70% faster evaluation, and 19,000× cheaper labeling. Demonstrated end-to-end training workflow for SWE LLM agents at scale.

Conclusion: By unifying storage-efficient sandboxing, distributed evaluation, automated data generation, and cost-effective labeling, RepoForge enables small-scale models (≤8B) to achieve state-of-the-art performance on SWE-Bench-Verified while solving critical bottlenecks in SWE agent training. Framework advances scalability and practicality of software engineering LLM development.

Abstract: Training software engineering (SWE) LLMs is bottlenecked by expensive
infrastructure, inefficient evaluation pipelines, scarce training data, and
costly quality control. We present RepoForge, an autonomous, end-to-end
pipeline that generates, evaluates, and trains SWE agents at scale. Our key
contributions include: (1) RepoForge-8B-Agent, achieving 17.4\% on
SWE-Bench-Verified~\citep{swebench_verified2024}, establishing new
state-of-the-art for $\leq$8B non-thinking LLMs; (2) 7,304 executable
environments auto-generated from real GitHub commits with zero manual
intervention; (3) 14$\times$ storage reduction (1.4GB $\rightarrow$ 102MB per
instance) via intelligent dependency management and image pruning; (4) $>$70\%
faster evaluation using a Ray-powered~\citep{ray2018} distributed RepoForge
harness; (5) 19,000$\times$ cheaper labeling through our automated
SPICE~\citep{spice2024} difficulty assessment technique. By unifying
storage-efficient sandboxing, Ray-powered evaluation harness, automated data
generation, SPICE-based labeling, and bubble-free RL scaffold, we demonstrate
that even $\leq$8B models can reach new state-of-the-art performance on
demanding benchmarks like SWE-Bench-Verified. Our approach addresses critical
bottlenecks in SWE agent training: high storage costs of container-based
evaluation, inefficient sequential reward pipelines, limited availability of
high-quality training data, expensive manual labeling, and multi-turn RL
pipeline bottlenecks.

*Jiahao Zhang,Xiao Cheng,Yuxiang Lei*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CG-FSPTA improves flow-sensitive pointer analysis efficiency by 7.27x with 33% less memory using constraint graphs instead of control flow graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-sensitive pointer analysis approaches based on control flow graphs suffer from computational inefficiencies due to complex structures when resolving points-to information.

Method: CG-FSPTA uses Flow-Sensitive Constraint Graphs (FSConsG) to combine structural advantages of set-constraint graphs with flow sensitivity through graph optimization and dynamic solving techniques.

Result: CG-FSPTA achieves 33.05% average memory reduction and 7.27x execution speedup compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining precision.

Conclusion: CG-FSPTA establishes a scalable, efficient solution for flow-sensitive pointer analysis, providing a robust foundation for future program analysis frameworks.

Abstract: Flow-sensitive pointer analysis constitutes an essential component of precise
program analysis for accurately modeling pointer behaviors by incorporating
control flows. Flow-sensitive pointer analysis is extensively used in alias
analysis, taint analysis, program understanding, compiler optimization, etc.
Existing flow-sensitive pointer analysis approaches, which are conducted based
on control flow graphs, have significantly advanced the precision of pointer
analysis via sophisticated techniques to leverage control flow information.
However, they inevitably suffer from computational inefficiencies when
resolving points-to information due to the inherent complex structures of
control flow graphs. We present CG-FSPTA, a Flow-Sensitive Constraint Graph
(FSConsG) based flow-sensitive pointer analysis to overcome the inefficiency of
control-flow-graph-based analysis. CG-FSPTA uses a flow-sensitive variant to
leverage the structural advantages of set-constraint graphs (which are commonly
used in flow-insensitive pointer analysis) while keeping the flow sensitivity
of variable definitions and uses, allowing the incorporation of sophisticated
graph optimization and dynamic solving techniques. In this way, CG-FSPTA
achieves significant efficiency improvements while keeping the precision of
flow-sensitive analysis. Experimental evaluations on benchmark programs
demonstrate that CG-FSPTA, significantly reduces both memory usage and
execution time while maintaining precision. In particular, by solving in the
FSConsG, CG-FSPTA achieves an average memory reduction of 33.05\% and
accelerates flow-sensitive pointer analysis by 7.27x compared to the
state-of-art method. These experimental results underscore the efficacy of
CG-FSPTA as a scalable solution to analyze large-scale software systems,
establishing a robust foundation for future advancements in efficient program
analysis frameworks.

### [78] [PCREQ: Automated Inference of Compatible Requirements for Python Third-party Library Upgrades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02023)
*Huashan Lei,Guanping Xiao,Yepang Liu,Zheng Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PCREQ addresses Python library upgrade compatibility issues (version and code) through an automated analysis framework, achieving 94.03% success on a large benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools miss code-level incompatibilities and cannot fully automate combined version/code compatibility resolution for Python TPL upgrades.

Method: Integrates six modules: knowledge acquisition, version compatibility assessment, API/module extraction, code compatibility assessment, version change, and missing TPL completion for iterative requirements.txt repair.

Result: 94.03% inference success rate (vs. 37-40% for baselines) on REQBench (2,095 cases), with 60.79s average processing time per case demonstrating practical efficiency.

Conclusion: PCREQ advances Python dependency maintenance automation by addressing both version and code compatibility issues through a systematic approach with empirical validation.

Abstract: Python third-party libraries (TPLs) are essential in modern software
development, but upgrades often cause compatibility issues, leading to system
failures. These issues fall into two categories: version compatibility issues
(VCIs) and code compatibility issues (CCIs). Existing tools mainly detect
dependency conflicts but overlook code-level incompatibilities, with no
solution fully automating the inference of compatible versions for both VCIs
and CCIs. To fill this gap, we propose PCREQ, the first approach to
automatically infer compatible requirements by combining version and code
compatibility analysis. PCREQ integrates six modules: knowledge acquisition,
version compatibility assessment, invoked APIs and modules extraction, code
compatibility assessment, version change, and missing TPL completion. PCREQ
collects candidate versions, checks for conflicts, identifies API usage,
evaluates code compatibility, and iteratively adjusts versions to generate a
compatible requirements.txt with a detailed repair report. To evaluate PCREQ,
we construct REQBench, a large-scale benchmark with 2,095 upgrade test cases
(including 406 unsolvable by pip). Results show PCREQ achieves a 94.03%
inference success rate, outperforming PyEGo (37.02%), ReadPyE (37.16%), and
LLM-based approaches (GPT-4o, DeepSeek V3/R1) by 18-20%. PCREQ processes each
case from REQBench in 60.79s on average, demonstrating practical efficiency.
PCREQ significantly reduces manual effort in troubleshooting upgrades,
advancing Python dependency maintenance automation.

*Yusaku Kato,Norihiro Yoshida,Erina Makihara,Katsuro Inoue*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BiFuzz is a two-stage fuzzer for automated testing of open-world video games, detecting sticking failures through gameplay strategy mutation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-world games have complex search spaces challenging traditional fuzzing methods; sticking failures remain undetected in automated testing.

Method: Two-stage fuzzer using gameplay strategy modeling followed by step-by-step mutation of movement paths and test cases.

Result: BiFuzz successfully identifies sticking failures by altering gameplay strategies; tool demonstrated via public GitHub repository with detailed video.

Conclusion: BiFuzz effectively addresses open-world game testing challenges through strategic input mutation, offering a practical solution for critical failure detection.

Abstract: Open-world video games present a broader search space than other games,
posing challenges for test automation. Fuzzing, which generates new inputs by
mutating an initial input, is commonly used to uncover failures. In this study,
we proposed BiFuzz, a two-stage fuzzer designed for automated testing of
open-world video games, and investigated its effectiveness. The results
revealed that BiFuzz mutated the overall strategy of gameplay and test cases,
including actual movement paths, step by step. Consequently, BiFuzz can detect
`stucking' failures. The tool and its video are at

### [80] [An MLIR-based Compilation Framework for Control Flow Management on CGRAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02167)
*Yuxuan Wang,Cristian Tirelli,Giovanni Ansaloni,Laura Pozzi,David Atienza*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a compiler framework that effectively manages control flow in CGRAs through modular transformations and optimizations, achieving up to 2.1X speedups over existing methods without hardware-specific dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art CGRA compilers are limited to data flow analysis and lack robust support for control flow, restricting application scope and relying on ad-hoc hardware units for divergence handling. This limits widespread adoption.

Method: Developed a hardware-agnostic compiler framework with control flow transformation/optimization passes and a resource-aware mapping algorithm for abstract CGRA meshes, addressing prior limitations in control flow and hardware constraints.

Result: Achieved 2.1X speedup improvements through pure compilation optimizations, successfully mapping applications with complex control flows onto CGRAs without requiring architectural modifications.

Conclusion: Compiler-level control flow management for CGRAs is viable and effective, enabling broader application support while maintaining hardware-agnostic flexibility and demonstrating significant performance gains through novel compilation strategies.

Abstract: Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) present both high flexibility
and efficiency, making them well-suited for the acceleration of intensive
workloads. Nevertheless, a key barrier towards their widespread adoption is
posed by CGRA compilation, which must cope with a multi-dimensional space
spanning both the spatial and the temporal domains. Indeed, state-of-the-art
compilers are limited in scope as they mostly deal with the data flow of
applications, while having little or no support for control flow. Hence, they
mostly target the mapping of single loops and/or delegate the management of
control flow divergences to ad-hoc hardware units.
  Conversely, in this paper we show that control flow can be effectively
managed and optimized at the compilation level, allowing for a broad set of
applications to be targeted while being hardware-agnostic and achieving high
performance. We embody our methodology in a modular compilation framework
consisting of transformation and optimization passes, enabling support for
applications with arbitrary control flows running on abstract CGRA meshes. We
also introduce a novel mapping methodology that acts as a compilation back-end,
addressing the limitations in available CGRA hardware resources and
guaranteeing a feasible solution in the compilation process. Our framework
achieves up to 2.1X speedups over state-of-the-art approaches, purely through
compilation optimizations.

### [81] [Highly Interactive Testing for Uninterrupted Development Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02176)
*Andrew Tropin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a library that enhances testing in Highly Interactive Development Environments (HIDEs) by enabling runtime test representation and immediate integration with HIDE tools during test failures, reducing reexecution delays to below one second.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional testing methods in CLI are isolated from HIDE tooling and cause disruptive delays due to coarse execution granularity and loss of runtime context, breaking developer focus.

Method: A library was developed to embed test representation in runtime within HIDEs, allowing seamless tooling access and optimized test reexecution with subsecond performance.

Result: The solution achieves test reexecution times under one second, maintaining developer flow by preserving runtime context and enabling rapid debugging within HIDEs.

Conclusion: The proposed library bridges the gap between testing and HIDE tooling, proving that tight integration and low-latency reexecution are critical for uninterrupted development practices.

Abstract: Highly interactive development environments (HIDEs) enable uninterrupted
development flow through continuous program evolution and rapid hypothesis
checking. However, traditional testing approaches -- typically executed
separately via CLI -- isolate tests from HIDE tooling (interactive debuggers,
value and stack inspectors, etc.) and introduce disruptive delays due to coarse
execution granularity and lack of runtime context. This disconnect breaks
development flow by exceeding critical attention thresholds. In this paper we
present a library that provides runtime representation for tests, allowing
tight integration with HIDEs, and enabling immediate access to HIDE tooling in
the context of test failure. We then describe development workflows enhanced
with testing and demonstrate how they achieve subsecond test reexecution times
crucial for maintaining developer focus.

*Vincenzo De Martino,Joel Castaño,Fabio Palomba,Xavier Franch,Silverio Martínez-Fernández*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the methodological integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Mining Software Repositories (MSR) research, proposing PRIMES 2.0, an empirical framework with 23 substeps to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of LLM-based MSR studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are gaining popularity in MSR research, but their full integration into the research pipeline lacks systematic investigation, leading to limited understanding of their empirical rigor.

Method: The authors conducted a mixed-method study combining a rapid review and a questionnaire survey to identify methodological approaches, threats to empirical rigor, and mitigation strategies in LLM4MSR research.

Result: Identified 15 methodological approaches, nine main threats, and 25 mitigation strategies. Introduced PRIMES 2.0, a six-stage framework with 23 substeps mapped to threats and strategies.

Conclusion: PRIMES 2.0 establishes a structured approach to LLM-based MSR research, addressing gaps in empirical methodology and promoting translucency through threat-mitigation mapping across the research lifecycle.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software engineering
research, offering new opportunities for automating repository mining tasks.
However, despite their growing popularity, the methodological integration of
LLMs into Mining Software Repositories (MSR) remains poorly understood.
Existing studies tend to focus on specific capabilities or performance
benchmarks, providing limited insight into how researchers utilize LLMs across
the full research pipeline. To address this gap, we conduct a mixed-method
study that combines a rapid review and questionnaire survey in the field of
LLM4MSR. We investigate (1) the approaches and (2) the threats that affect the
empirical rigor of researchers involved in this field. Our findings reveal 15
methodological approaches, nine main threats, and 25 mitigation strategies.
Building on these findings, we present PRIMES 2.0, a refined empirical
framework organized into six stages, comprising 23 methodological substeps,
each mapped to specific threats and corresponding mitigation strategies,
providing prescriptive and adaptive support throughout the lifecycle of
LLM-based MSR studies. Our work contributes to establishing a more transparent
and reproducible foundation for LLM-based MSR research.

contexts. To achieve this, it is important to build, operate, and continuously
improve dialogue systems correctly and efficiently. Accordingly, in addition to
applying existing software engineering knowledge, it is becoming increasingly
important to evolve software engineering tailored specifically to dialogue
systems. In this paper, we enumerate the knowledge areas of dialogue systems
engineering based on those of software engineering, as defined in the Software
Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) Version 4.0, and survey each area. Based
on this survey, we identify unexplored topics in each area and discuss the
future direction of dialogue systems engineering.

### [85] [Vision Language Model-based Testing of Industrial Autonomous Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02338)
*Jiahui Wu,Chengjie Lu,Aitor Arrieta,Shaukat Ali,Thomas Peyrucain*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes RVSG, a VLM-based method for generating human-violating scenarios to test industrial AMRs in simulation, effectively revealing uncertain robot behaviors while avoiding real-world risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing AMRs in real-world environments is costly, impractical, and potentially hazardous due to unpredictable human behavior. There's a need for scalable safety validation methods under diverse human interactions.

Method: RVSG uses a Vision Language Model to synthesize diverse human behaviors violating specified safety/functional requirements for AMRs. The approach generates realistic scenarios in simulation using PAL Robotics' latest AMR platform.

Result: RVSG outperforms baselines in generating requirement-violating scenarios. The generated scenarios increase robot behavior variability, successfully uncovering uncertain behaviors in simulated testing environments.

Conclusion: The proposed VLM-based testing approach enables effective safety validation of AMRs under unpredictable human interactions in controlled simulations, supporting robust industrial deployment.

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are deployed in diverse environments (e.g.,
warehouses, retail spaces, and offices), where they work alongside humans.
Given that human behavior can be unpredictable and that AMRs may not have been
trained to handle all possible unknown and uncertain behaviors, it is important
to test AMRs under a wide range of human interactions to ensure their safe
behavior. Moreover, testing in real environments with actual AMRs and humans is
often costly, impractical, and potentially hazardous (e.g., it could result in
human injury). To this end, we propose a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based
testing approach (RVSG) for industrial AMRs developed by PAL Robotics in Spain.
Based on the functional and safety requirements, RVSG uses the VLM to generate
diverse human behaviors that violate these requirements. We evaluated RVSG with
several requirements and navigation routes in a simulator using the latest AMR
from PAL Robotics. Our results show that, compared with the baseline, RVSG can
effectively generate requirement-violating scenarios. Moreover, RVSG-generated
scenarios increase variability in robot behavior, thereby helping reveal their
uncertain behaviors.

### [86] [JC-Finder: Detecting Java Clone-based Third-Party Library by Class-level Tree Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02397)
*Lida Zhao,Chaofan Li,Yueming Wu,Lyuye Zhang,Jiahui Wu,Chengwei Liu,Sen Chen,Yutao Hu,Zhengzi Xu,Yi Liu,Jingquan Ge,Jun Sun,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: JC-Finder is a new Java-specific clone-based Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool achieving 0.818 F1-score and 9x faster detection than existing tools, uncovering a significant amount of previously undetected third-party library reuse in GitHub projects.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Java's prevalent but poorly managed third-party library (TPL) cloning introduces maintenance risks and Copyright violations. Clone-based SCA tools lack Java specificity, and directly applying cross-language solutions proves ineffective due to the lack of appropriate training data and language-specific challenges.


Method: JC-Finder employs class-level feature extraction, preserves inter-function semantic relationships, and filters out trivial/duplicated elements through a multi-phase filtering strategy. It utilizes a supervised machine learning approach with training data derived from Java-specific patterns.

Result: Evaluated on 9,965 Maven libraries and 1,000 GitHub projects, JC-Finder achieved 0.818 F1-score (0.427 improvement over previous tools) and 14.2 sec/analysis time (9x faster). Scanning 7,947 projects identified 2,142 TPLs with code clones, revealing 26.2% more TPL reuse than existing package managers could detect.

Conclusion: This study establishes JC-Finder as the first specialized Java clone-based SCA tool, demonstrating significant performance advantages in both accuracy and speed for detecting untracked TPL reuse. The findings highlight the prevalence of undetected code cloning in Java projects and the importance of language-specific approaches to Software Composition Analysis.

Abstract: While reusing third-party libraries (TPL) facilitates software development,
its chaotic management has brought great threats to software maintenance and
the unauthorized use of source code also raises ethical problems such as
misconduct on copyrighted code. To identify TPL reuse in projects, Software
Composition Analysis (SCA) is employed, and two categories of SCA techniques
are used based on how TPLs are introduced: clone-based SCA and
package-manager-based SCA (PM-based SCA). Although introducing TPLs by clones
is prevalent in Java, no clone-based SCA tools are specially designed for Java.
Also, directly applying clone-based SCA techniques from other tools is
problematic. To fill this gap, we introduce JC-Finder, a novel clone-based SCA
tool that aims to accurately and comprehensively identify instances of TPL
reuse introduced by source code clones in Java projects. JC-Finder achieves
both accuracy and efficiency in identifying TPL reuse from code cloning by
capturing features at the class level, maintaining inter-function
relationships, and excluding trivial or duplicated elements. To evaluate the
efficiency of JC-Finder, we applied it to 9,965 most popular Maven libraries as
reference data and tested the TPL reuse of 1,000 GitHub projects. The result
shows that JC-Finder achieved an F1-score of 0.818, outperforming the other
function-level tool by 0.427. The average time taken for resolving TPL reuse is
14.2 seconds, which is approximately 9 times faster than the other tool. We
further applied JC-Finder to 7,947 GitHub projects, revealing TPL reuse by code
clones in 789 projects (about 9.89% of all projects) and identifying a total of
2,142 TPLs. JC-Finder successfully detects 26.20% more TPLs that are not
explicitly declared in package managers.

*Xinyi Wang,Qinghua Xu,Paolo Arcaini,Shaukat Ali,Thomas Peyrucain*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces QuReBot, a hybrid quantum machine learning framework for regression testing of autonomous mobile robots. It combines quantum reservoir computing with a neural network to reduce prediction errors by 15% compared to classical methods, addressing challenges in creating effective test oracles for unknown environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot software upgrades necessitate regression testing, but constructing reliable test oracles (expected behavior predictions) is difficult due to unpredictable operating environments. Classical methods fall short in accuracy and speed for complex robotic systems.

Method: Proposes QuReBot, a hybrid quantum machine learning framework integrating quantum reservoir computing (QRC) with residual-connection-inspired neural networks. QRC provides faster training and higher precision, while the neural network enhances convergence stability.

Result: QuReBot achieves 15% lower prediction error than classical neural networks. QRC alone fails to converge, but the hybrid framework remains stable and effective. Practical configurations for optimal performance are identified.

Conclusion: QuReBot effectively addresses test oracle challenges in robot software regression testing by combining QRC with neural networks. The hybrid approach improves accuracy and convergence, offering usable guidance for future robot software testing in complex environments.

Abstract: Robots are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives, interacting with
both the environment and humans to perform their tasks. The software of such
robots often undergoes upgrades, for example, to add new functionalities, fix
bugs, or delete obsolete functionalities. As a result, regression testing of
robot software becomes necessary. However, determining the expected correct
behavior of robots (i.e., a test oracle) is challenging due to the potentially
unknown environments in which the robots must operate. To address this
challenge, machine learning (ML)-based test oracles present a viable solution.
This paper reports on the development of a test oracle to support regression
testing of autonomous mobile robots built by PAL Robotics (Spain), using
quantum machine learning (QML), which enables faster training and the
construction of more precise test oracles. Specifically, we propose a hybrid
framework, QuReBot, that combines both quantum reservoir computing (QRC) and a
simple neural network, inspired by residual connection, to predict the expected
behavior of a robot. Results show that QRC alone fails to converge in our case,
yielding high prediction error. In contrast, QuReBot converges and achieves 15%
reduction of prediction error compared to the classical neural network
baseline. Finally, we further examine QuReBot under different configurations
and offer practical guidance on optimal settings to support future robot
software testing.

*Daniele Cipollone,Egor Bogomolov,Arie van Deursen,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new lightweight, model-agnostic approach for ranking static code completions using prefix trees and greedy decoding to improve accuracy and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code completion systems rely on heuristics or user-log-based models that fail to generalize context and rankings across diverse projects and coding styles, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The method constructs a prefix tree of valid completions and employs a single greedy decoding pass to compute token-level scores, enabling precise ranking without beam search, prompt engineering, or model modifications.

Result: The proposed approach is shown to be fast and architecture-agnostic while maintaining compatibility with existing deployed code completion models, demonstrating its practicality for IDE integration.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable solution for enhancing code completion tools by leveraging language models in a way that avoids complex parameterization and preserves existing model capabilities.

Abstract: Token-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting
relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically
derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are
ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by
users. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight
machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to
capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles.
In this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions
using language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method
organizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy
decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a
precise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or
model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible
with already deployed models for code completion. These findings highlight a
practical and effective pathway for integrating language models into already
existing tools within IDEs, and ultimately providing smarter and more
responsive developer assistance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NES is an LLM-based code editing framework that improves developer productivity through instruction-free next edit prediction, leveraging dual-model architecture and novel datasets to overcome latency issues and reduce dependency on natural language instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI code editing tools rely heavily on explicit natural language instructions and suffer from high latency, limiting their workflow integration. Developers exhibit consistent historical editing patterns that could be utilized for more efficient prediction.

Method: The framework employs a dual-model design with a dual-attention mechanism for low-latency inference, trained on SFT and DAPO datasets derived from real developer interactions. It uses continuous Tab key interactions for seamless adoption.

Result: Achieves 75.6% and 81.6% accuracy in next edit location prediction, with 91.36% Edit Similarity (ES) and 27.7% Edit Match Rate (EMR) for intent-aligned edits. Outperforms state-of-the-art models and improves open-source CodeLLMs with new datasets.

Conclusion: NES demonstrates a viable instruction-free code editing paradigm that can be scaled in production environments, validated by adoption at a 20k+ developer FinTech company and superior performance metrics on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Code editing, including modifying, refactoring, and maintaining existing
code, is the most frequent task in software development and has garnered
significant attention from AI-powered tools. However, existing solutions that
translate explicit natural language instructions into code edits face critical
limitations, such as heavy reliance on human instruction input and high
latency, which hinder their effective integration into a developer's workflow.
We observe that developers' habitual behaviors and coding objectives are often
reflected in their historical editing patterns, making this data key to
addressing existing limitations. To leverage these insights, we propose NES
(Next Edit Suggestion), an LLM-driven code editing framework that delivers an
instruction-free and low-latency experience. Built on a dual-model architecture
and trained with our high-quality SFT and DAPO datasets, NES enhances
productivity by understanding developer intent while optimizing inference to
minimize latency. NES is a scalable, industry-ready solution with a continuous
Tab key interaction workflow, seamlessly adopted by a FinTech company with over
20,000 developers. Evaluations on real-world datasets show NES achieves 75.6%
and 81.6% accuracy in two tasks of predicting next edit locations, alongside
91.36% ES and 27.7% EMR for intent-aligned edits, outperforming SOTA models.
Our open-sourced SFT and DAPO datasets have been demonstrated to enhance the
performance of open-source CodeLLMs. The demonstration of NES is available at

*Elijah Kayode Adejumo,Brittany Johnson,Mariam Guizani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes project resilience in open source software via commit patterns, finding only 2% of repositories achieve daily stability, with larger yearly commit counts not necessarily indicating resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding organizational OSS reliance, existing health metrics lack focus on post-disturbance project resilience (recovering from contributor departures, security issues, and bug spikes).

Method: Built on the Composite Stability Index (CSI), validated commit frequency patterns across 100 highly ranked repositories, examining daily/weekly/monthly stability alongside programming language, blockchain focus, and governance models.

Result: 2% daily stability, 29% weekly, 50% monthly稳定性; programming languages and blockchain repos最 stable; two repos achieved stability across all granularity levels; yearly commit throughput doesn't consistently imply stability; issue-resolution times, PR merge rates, and community engagement metrics can enrich resilience analysis.

Conclusion: Stable commit patterns signal mature governance, sustained contributors, and robust processes essential for OSS resilience. Stability-based risk evaluation should incorporate diverse metrics beyond just commit frequency to improve project management and risk mitigation.

Abstract: Open source software (OSS) generates trillions of dollars in economic value
and has become essential to technical infrastructures worldwide. As
organizations increasingly depend on OSS, understanding project evolution is
critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one
dimension remains understudied: project resilience -- the ability to return to
normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures, security
vulnerabilities, and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit
patterns reflect underlying project characteristics such as mature governance,
sustained contributors, and robust development processes that enable
resilience. Building on the Composite Stability Index (CSI) framework, we
empirically validate commit frequency patterns across 100 highly ranked
repositories. Our findings reveal that only 2\% of repositories exhibit daily
stability, 29\% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly
stability, while half remain unstable across all temporal levels. Programming
languages and blockchain applications were the most stable. We identified two
exemplary repositories that achieved stability at all three granularities,
whose governance models, CI cadence, and release policies could serve as
reference frameworks. We observed that large yearly commit throughput does not
necessarily correlate with stability. Beyond commits, stability can be enriched
with issue-resolution times, PR merge rates, and community-engagement metrics
to broaden resilience assessment and sharpen stability-based risk evaluation.

*Elijah Kayode Adejumo,Brittany Johnson,Mariam Guizani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the potential and challenges of using LLMs to translate open-source technical documentation (non-English). It introduces TRIFID, a framework to evaluate translation fidelity, and highlights both accurate translation ability and structural/formatting preservation issues in LLM outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite global contributor bases, non-English documentation in open source projects remains scarce. The study aims to understand LLM capabilities for technical documentation translation to improve accessibility and address internationalization challenges.

Method: Authors evaluated existing community translation activity in 50 repositories and compared English-to-German translations using ChatGPT-4 and Claude. They developed TRIFID to automatically score translation fidelity regarding code preservation, link integrity, and formatting consistency.

Result: 1) Translation activity was rare and concentrated in larger repositories, with community-driven contributions. 2) LLMs provided accurate translations but struggled with maintaining structural elements (e.g., hyperlinks) and formatting. 3) TRIFID effectively identifies translation fidelity issues.

Conclusion: LLMs offer promising translation accuracy for technical documentation but require improved structural preservation. TRIFID provides a foundation for automated LLM-driven documentation internationalization by identifying fidelity gaps, suggesting future CI pipeline integration potential.

Abstract: While open source communities attract diverse contributors globally, few
repositories provide essential documentation in languages other than English.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
software engineering tasks and translations across domains. However, little is
known about LLM capabilities in translating open-source technical
documentation, which mixes natural language, code, URLs, and markdown
formatting. To understand the need and potential for LLMs in technical
documentation translation, we evaluated community translation activity and
English-to-German translations of 50 README files using OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 and
Anthropic's Claude. We found scarce translation activity, mostly in larger
repositories and community-driven in nature. LLM performance comparison
suggests they can provide accurate translations. However, analysis revealed
fidelity challenges: both models struggled to preserve structural components
(e.g., hyperlinks) and exhibited formatting inconsistencies. These findings
highlight both promise and challenges of LLM-assisted documentation
internationalization. As a first step toward translation-aware continuous
integration pipelines, we introduce TRIFID, an early-stage translation fidelity
scoring framework that automatically checks how well translations preserve
code, links, and formatting. Our efforts provide a foundation for automated
LLM-driven support for creating and maintaining open source documentation.

Result: MLpylint demonstrated effectiveness and usefulness in detecting ML-specific code smells. Future work includes integrating it into development workflows for improved productivity.

Conclusion: The study successfully developed and validated MLpylint as a tool to address ML-specific code smells, with plans to enhance its integration for improved developer environments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming vital to many
industries. Currently, the research on code smells in ML applications lacks
tools and studies that address the identification and validity of ML-specific
code smells. This work investigates suitable methods and tools to design and
develop a static code analysis tool (MLpylint) based on code smell criteria.
This research employed the Design Science Methodology. In the problem
identification phase, a literature review was conducted to identify ML-specific
code smells. In solution design, a secondary literature review and
consultations with experts were performed to select methods and tools for
implementing the tool. We evaluated the tool on data from 160 open-source ML
applications sourced from GitHub. We also conducted a static validation through
an expert survey involving 15 ML professionals. The results indicate the
effectiveness and usefulness of the MLpylint. We aim to extend our current
approach by investigating ways to introduce MLpylint seamlessly into
development workflows, fostering a more productive and innovative developer
environment.

### [93] [Meta-RAG on Large Codebases Using Code Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02611)
*Vali Tawosia,Salwa Alamir,Xiaomo Liu,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes Meta-RAG, a RAG-based multi-agent system using LLMs and information retrieval to achieve SOTA bug localization rates (84.67% file-level, 53.0% function-level) by condensing codebases into structured summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software development requires complex code maintenance, and improving bug localization in large codebases is critical for efficient troubleshooting. Existing techniques may not scale effectively to vast, unstructured code repositories.

Method: Meta-RAG utilizes multi-agent LLMs via a two-step process: (1) Codebase condensation using summaries to reduce size by 79.8% and (2) Agent-based localization identifying critical code components. The system operates on structured natural language representations through RAG principles.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 84.67% file-level and 53.0% function-level correct localization rates on SWE-bench Lite dataset, demonstrating effectiveness in isolating critical code regions for bug resolution.

Conclusion: Meta-RAG outperforms existing methods in codebase bug localization by combining retrieval with LLM agent analysis of condensed summaries. The approach enables scalable, structured code maintenance for large software systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such
domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of
a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex
ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the
realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to
localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and
LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an
average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation.
We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical
for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of
Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores
84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization
rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
