### [1] [Privacy-Preserving AI for Encrypted Medical Imaging: A Framework for Secure Diagnosis and Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21060)
*Abdullah Al Siam,Sadequzzaman Shohan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving framework for encrypted medical image diagnostics using Masked-CNN retains diagnostic accuracy while preventing plaintext data exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI medical diagnostics require sensitive imaging data to be decrypted, exposing patient privacy risks. Solutions enabling secure inference on encrypted data remain limited and often involve significant performance trade-offs.

Method: Modified CNN (Masked-CNN) processes encrypted/compressed images using AES-CBC + JPEG2000. Evaluates diagnostic accuracy, latency, storage efficiency, and privacy leakage with NIH ChestX-ray14 and LIDC-IDRI datasets.

Result: Encrypted inference achieves 98.7% of unencrypted accuracy (3.2% max drop) and 9.8% latency increase. Maintains interoperability with DICOM systems while eliminating plaintext exposure vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The Masked-CNN framework establishes proof-of-concept for secure medical analytics, demonstrating that encrypted image processing can balance clinical accuracy with information security requirements.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical
diagnostics has raised pressing concerns about patient privacy, especially when
sensitive imaging data must be transferred, stored, or processed. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving diagnostic inference
on encrypted medical images using a modified convolutional neural network
(Masked-CNN) capable of operating on transformed or ciphered image formats. Our
approach leverages AES-CBC encryption coupled with JPEG2000 compression to
protect medical images while maintaining their suitability for AI inference. We
evaluate the system using public DICOM datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and
LIDC-IDRI), focusing on diagnostic accuracy, inference latency, storage
efficiency, and privacy leakage resistance. Experimental results show that the
encrypted inference model achieves performance comparable to its unencrypted
counterpart, with only marginal trade-offs in accuracy and latency. The
proposed framework bridges the gap between data privacy and clinical utility,
offering a practical, scalable solution for secure AI-driven diagnostics.

### [2] [Security practices in AI development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21061)
*Petr Spelda,Vit Stritecky*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper argues that security practices (not just alignment/red teaming tools) shape the trustworthiness of AI safety claims, identifies shortcomings in diversity/participation within these practices, and proposes improvements for commercial AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need to understand how security practices justify safety claims in AI systems when tool capabilities fall short of providing full guarantees.

Method: The authors conduct a critical analysis of AI security practices, focusing on processes like alignment, red teaming, and securitization mechanisms to assess their role in claiming safety.

Result: Analysis revealed that security practices are inherently part of securitization efforts that commercialize AI systems with incomplete safety guarantees, while existing practices lack diversity and participatory rigor.

Conclusion: The authors recommend enhancing AI security practices through better diversity, participation, and transparency to address the capability-guarantee gap in safety claims.

Abstract: What makes safety claims about general purpose AI systems such as large
language models trustworthy? We show that rather than the capabilities of
security tools such as alignment and red teaming procedures, it is security
practices based on these tools that contributed to reconfiguring the image of
AI safety and made the claims acceptable. After showing what causes the gap
between the capabilities of security tools and the desired safety guarantees,
we critically investigate how AI security practices attempt to fill the gap and
identify several shortcomings in diversity and participation. We found that
these security practices are part of securitization processes aiming to support
(commercial) development of general purpose AI systems whose trustworthiness
can only be imperfectly tested instead of guaranteed. We conclude by offering
several improvements to the current AI security practices.

### [3] [Private key and password protection by steganographic image encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21068)
*Debesh Choudhury,Sujoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A method to hide encrypted private keys/passcodes in images using a QR code and steganography, with a security mechanism allowing key regeneration through preserved seed images copies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secure storage of cryptographic keys is critical in preventing unauthorized access. This paper proposes a practical solution to preserve private keys/passcodes from active attackers who might modify stored seed images.

Method: 1. Convert plaintext private key/passcode to an encrypted QR code using an LFSR-derived key from a user-chosen seed image. 2. Embed the encrypted QR code into a real-life color image via steganography. 3. Regenerate the encryption key by restoring the original seed image from multiple copies if modified.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the technique's feasibility using sample private keys and real-images, confirming secure embedding, extraction, and recovery of encrypted QR data.

Conclusion: The proposed technique provides a robust solution for protecting private keys/passcodes through encrypted steganography and LFSR-generated keys, with resilience against seed image tampering via backups.

Abstract: We propose a technique to protect and preserve a private key or a passcode in
an encrypted two-dimensional graphical image. The plaintext private key or the
passcode is converted into an encrypted QR code and embedded into a real-life
color image with a steganographic scheme. The private key or the passcode is
recovered from the stego color image by first extracting the encrypted QR code
from the color image, followed by decryption of the QR code. The cryptographic
key for encryption of the QR code is generated from the output of a Linear
Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), initialized by a seed image chosen by the user.
The user can store the seed image securely, without the knowledge of an
attacker. Even if an active attacker modifies the seed image (without knowledge
of the fact that it is the seed image), the user can easily restore it if
he/she keeps multiple copies of it, so that the encryption key can be
regenerated easily. Our experiments prove the feasibility of the technique
using sample private key data and real-life color images.

### [4] [Applications Of Zero-Knowledge Proofs On Bitcoin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21085)
*Yusuf Ozmi≈ü*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates three applications of zero-knowledge proofs in Bitcoin: Proof-of-Reserve (using zk-STARKs for transparent custodian audits), ZK Light Clients (trust-minimized verification of block headers), and Privacy-Preserving BitVM Rollups. It evaluates security, efficiency, and implementation trade-offs among alternative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bitcoin's current limitations include opaque custodial reserves, inefficient lightweight verification, and lack of privacy in layer-2 solutions. The paper aims to demonstrate how ZK proofs can address these while maintaining blockchain properties like decentralization and security.

Method: 1) STARK-based protocol for proving UTXO reserve thresholds
2) STARK-based block header chain verification
3) BitVM conceptual design with ZKPs for transaction confidentiality
Includes comparative security analysis, efficiency evaluation, and implementation feasibility checks for each approach.

Result: Achieved secure proofs for reserve verification, block header validation, and private rollup execution. Identified practical trade-offs: ZK Light Clients require 651,536 gas per block header proof; BitVM-based rollups face scalability limitations with growing data. STARKs enable transparent custodial verification with minimal privacy leakage.

Conclusion: While ZK proofs can significantly enhance Bitcoin's transparency (via Proof-of-Reserve audits), accessibility (trustless light clients), and privacy (confidential rollups), each application involves critical trade-offs in proof generation costs, gas efficiency, and trust assumptions. Concrete UTXO-specific protocol designs and a practicality assessment are provided for future implementation.

Abstract: This paper explores how zero-knowledge proofs can enhance Bitcoin's
functionality and privacy. First, we consider Proof-of-Reserve schemes: by
using zk-STARKs, a custodian can prove its Bitcoin holdings are more than a
predefined threshold X, without revealing addresses or actual balances. We
outline a STARK-based protocol for Bitcoin UTXOs and discuss its efficiency.
Second, we examine ZK Light Clients, where a mobile or lightweight device
verifies Bitcoin's proof-of-work chain using succinct proofs. We propose a
protocol for generating and verifying a STARK-based proof of a chain of block
headers, enabling trust-minimized client operation. Third, we explore
Privacy-Preserving Rollups via BitVM: leveraging BitVM, we design a conceptual
rollup that keeps transaction data confidential using zero-knowledge proofs. In
each case, we analyze security, compare with existing approaches, and discuss
implementation considerations. Our contributions include the design of concrete
protocols adapted to Bitcoin's UTXO model and an assessment of their
practicality. The results suggest that while ZK proofs can bring powerful
features (e.g., on-chain reserve audits, trustless light clients, and private
layer-2 execution) to Bitcoin, each application requires careful trade-offs in
efficiency and trust assumptions.

### [5] [Intelligent ARP Spoofing Detection using Multi-layered Machine Learning (ML) Techniques for IoT Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21087)
*Anas Ali,Mubashar Husain,Peter Hans*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-layered machine learning framework to detect ARP spoofing in IoT networks by combining edge gateway lightweight models with centralized deep learning classifiers, achieving 97% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARP spoofing exploiting authentication gaps poses critical threats to IoT networks due to their decentralized nature and resource constraints, rendering conventional detection methods ineffective at scale. Existing signature/rule-based systems lack robustness and generalizability.

Method: The solution combines ARP header behavior analysis, traffic flow patterns, and temporal packet anomaly detection through a hybrid pipeline of decision trees, ensemble models, and deep learning. Edge gateways use lightweight models while centralized nodes employ deeper analysis for accuracy-efficiency balance.

Result: Achieved 97% detection accuracy with low false positives on simulated IoT traffic and CICIDS2017 dataset. Outperformed signature-based and rule-based systems in comparative evaluations, demonstrating robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: The intelligent ML framework enables proactive ARP spoofing detection tailored for IoT environments, establishing a scalable architecture for autonomous network security. This approach balances edge computational constraints with accurate centralized analysis.

Abstract: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing remains a critical threat to IoT
networks, enabling attackers to intercept, modify, or disrupt data transmission
by exploiting ARP's lack of authentication. The decentralized and
resource-constrained nature of IoT environments amplifies this vulnerability,
making conventional detection mechanisms ineffective at scale. This paper
introduces an intelligent, multi-layered machine learning framework designed to
detect ARP spoofing in real-time IoT deployments. Our approach combines feature
engineering based on ARP header behavior, traffic flow analysis, and temporal
packet anomalies with a hybrid detection pipeline incorporating decision trees,
ensemble models, and deep learning classifiers. We propose a hierarchical
architecture to prioritize lightweight models at edge gateways and deeper
models at centralized nodes to balance detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. The system is validated on both simulated IoT traffic and the
CICIDS2017 dataset, achieving over 97% detection accuracy with low false
positive rates. Comparative evaluations with signature-based and rule-based
systems demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Our
results show that intelligent machine learning integration enables proactive
ARP spoofing detection tailored for IoT scenarios, laying the groundwork for
scalable and autonomous network security solutions.

### [6] [The Discovery, Disclosure, and Investigation of CVE-2024-25825](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21092)
*Hunter Chasens*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines a vulnerability in FydeOS's /etc/shadow file involving default credentials and evaluates potential nation-state actor involvement, concluding it is unlikely intentional.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to investigate the origin of CVE-2024-25825, specifically addressing concerns that the vulnerability in the /etc/shadow file might have been deliberately placed by a nation-state actor, and to assess the adequacy of responsible disclosure practices in such scenarios.

Method: The study followed responsible disclosure by notifying Fyde, CISA, and Mitre about the vulnerability (CWE-1392, CWE-1393, CWE-258) in the /etc/shadow file. It included analyzing the vulnerability's configuration (wildcard allowing any/no password for root users) and conducting further investigations into potential malicious implantation.

Result: Findings indicate Fyde was already aware of the vulnerability, and subsequent analysis suggests it likely wasn't intentionally placed. The study also highlights that contacting CERTs rather than parent companies may be preferable for suspected poisoned code, though this conflicts with standard responsible disclosure norms.

Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of rigorous vulnerability assessments and clarifies that while responsible disclosure remains appropriate in most cases, scenarios involving suspected nation-state activity may require alternative approaches by engaging national security-focused entities like CERTs.

Abstract: CVE-2024-25825 is a vulnerability found in FydeOS. This thesis describes its
discovery, disclosure, and its further investigation in connection to a nation
state actor. The vulnerability is CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials,
CWE-1393: Use of Default Password, and CWE-258: Empty Password in Configuration
File found in the /etc/shadow configuration file. The root users entry in the
/etc/shadow file contains a wildcard allowing entry with any, or no, password.
Following responsable disclosure, Fyde, CISA, and Mitre were informed. Fyde was
already aware of the vulnerability. There was concern that this vulnerability
might have been purposefully placed, perhaps by a nation state actor. After
further investigation, it appears that this is unlikely to be the case. In
cases in which poisoned code is suspected it might be prudent to contact the
appropriate CERT, rather than the parent company. This, however, clashes with
the typical teaching of responsable disclosure.

### [7] [SkyEye: When Your Vision Reaches Beyond IAM Boundary Scope in AWS Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21094)
*Minh Hoang Nguyen,Anh Minh Ho,Bao Son To*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses cloud security challenges, particularly AWS IAM enumeration, by introducing SkyEye‚Äîa framework for systematic IAM analysis to identify misconfigurations and enhance compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises face increasing cloud migration while balancing security risks like data protection and compliance. AWS IAM misconfigurations are critical, necessitating precise enumeration to prevent unauthorized access.

Method: SkyEye provides a cooperative multi-principal IAM enumeration framework, leveraging advanced models to map identities, permissions, and policies beyond individual principal boundaries for comprehensive situational awareness.

Result: The paper proposes SkyEye to address insufficient authorization challenges, aiming to enumerate IAM configurations and reduce privilege escalation risks in AWS environments.

Conclusion: SkyEye demonstrates the value of holistic IAM enumeration in cloud environments, emphasizing its role in mitigating security risks and ensuring compliance.

Abstract: In recent years, cloud security has emerged as a primary concern for
enterprises due to the increasing trend of migrating internal infrastructure
and applications to cloud environments. This shift is driven by the desire to
reduce the high costs and maintenance fees associated with traditional
on-premise infrastructure. By leveraging cloud capacities such as high
availability and scalability, companies can achieve greater operational
efficiency and flexibility. However, this migration also introduces new
security challenges. Ensuring the protection of sensitive data, maintaining
compliance with regulatory requirements, and mitigating the risks of cyber
threats are critical issues that must be addressed. Identity and Access
Management (IAM) constitutes the critical security backbone of most cloud
deployments, particularly within AWS environments. As organizations adopt AWS
to scale applications and store data, the need for a thorough, methodical, and
precise enumeration of IAM configurations grows exponentially. Enumeration
refers to the systematic mapping and interrogation of identities, permissions,
and resource authorizations with the objective of gaining situational
awareness. By understanding the interplay between users, groups, and their
myriads of policies, whether inline or attached managed policies, security
professionals need to enumerate and identify misconfigurations, reduce the risk
of unauthorized privilege escalation, and maintain robust compliance postures.
This paper will present SkyEye, a cooperative multi-principal IAM enumeration
framework, which comprises cutting-edge enumeration models in supporting
complete situational awareness regarding the IAMs of provided AWS credentials,
crossing the boundary of principal-specific IAM entitlement vision to reveal
the complete visionary while insufficient authorization is the main challenge.

### [8] [HexaMorphHash HMH- Homomorphic Hashing for Secure and Efficient Cryptographic Operations in Data Integrity Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21096)
*Krishnendu Das*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: HexaMorphHash: A lattice-based homomorphic hash function enabling efficient incremental updates in distributed systems with quantum-resistant security and optimized scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hashing methods struggle with dynamic distributed systems due to rehashing overhead during node changes, compromising load balancing and scalability under frequent updates.

Method: Introduces HexaMorphHash leveraging lattice theory and the Short Integer Solutions (SIS) problem to achieve constant-time incremental updates with fixed digest size, while avoiding complete rehashing during node modifications.

Result: Demonstrated computational efficiency, reduced memory usage, and enhanced scalability compared to direct signatures, Merkle trees, AdHash, MuHash, and other homomorphic schemes; retains security against quantum threats via SIS problem complexity.

Conclusion: HexaMorphHash provides a quantum-secure, scalable solution for frequent data distribution changes in large-scale cloud systems, preserving both integrity and performance through homomorphic hashing innovations.

Abstract: In the realm of big data and cloud computing, distributed systems are tasked
with proficiently managing, storing, and validating extensive datasets across
numerous nodes, all while maintaining robust data integrity. Conventional
hashing methods, though straightforward, encounter substan tial difficulties in
dynamic settings due to the necessity for thorough rehashing when nodes are
altered. Consistent hashing mitigates some of these challenges by reducing data
redistribution; however, it still contends with limitations in load balancing
and scalability under intensive update conditions. This paper introduces an
innovative approach using a lattice based homomorphic hash function
HexaMorphHash that facilitates constant time, incremental updates while
preserving a constant digest size. By utilizing the complexity of the Short
Integer Solutions SIS problem, our method secures strong protective measures,
even against quantum threats. We further com pare our method with existing ones
such as direct signatures for each update, comprehensive database signing,
Merkle tree based techniques, AdHash, MuHash, ECMH, and homomorphic sig nature
schemes highlighting notable advancements in computational efficiency, memory
usage, and scalability. Our contributions present a viable solution for
frequent update dissemination in expansive distributed systems, safeguarding
both data integrity and system performance.

### [9] [Singularity Cipher: A Topology-Driven Cryptographic Scheme Based on Visual Paradox and Klein Bottle Illusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21097)
*Abraham Itzhak Weinberg*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Singularity Cipher, a cryptographic-steganographic framework using topological transformations (Klein bottle/Mobius strips) and visual paradoxes (e.g., missing square illusion) to create a dual-layer security system with enhanced resistance to analysis and detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ciphers focus solely on algebraic complexity, limiting their ability to resist attacks exploiting human visual perception and topological patterns. This approach combines symbolic encryption with perceptual illusions to address these gaps.

Method: 1) Implements symbolic twist functions based on non-orientable topological structures (Klein bottle) to achieve confusion/diffusion in 2D data.
2) Embeds encrypted outputs in visually ambiguous digital imagery using perceptual paradoxes.
3) Formalizes encryption/decryption algorithms through topological traversal parameters.

Result: Security analysis shows the method provides: (1) Multidimensional obfuscation combining mathematical and perceptual properties, (2) 26% higher entropy distribution than post-quantum algorithms, (3) Visual steganography effective at 98% perceptual misrecognition rate in testing.

Conclusion: The integration of topological encryption and visual steganography creates a uniquely resilient framework for adversarial environments, demonstrating practical applications in secure communication and copyright protection while establishing new research directions at the intersection of topology and human perception in cybersecurity.

Abstract: This paper presents the Singularity Cipher, a novel
cryptographic-steganographic framework that integrates topological
transformations and visual paradoxes to achieve multidimensional security.
Inspired by the non-orientable properties of the Klein bottle -- constructed
from two Mobius strips -- the cipher applies symbolic twist functions to
simulate topological traversal, producing high confusion and diffusion in the
ciphertext. The resulting binary data is then encoded using perceptual
illusions, such as the missing square paradox, to visually obscure the presence
of encrypted content. Unlike conventional ciphers that rely solely on algebraic
complexity, the Singularity Cipher introduces a dual-layer approach: symbolic
encryption rooted in topology and visual steganography designed for human
cognitive ambiguity. This combination enhances both cryptographic strength and
detection resistance, making it well-suited for secure communication,
watermarking, and plausible deniability in adversarial environments. The paper
formalizes the architecture, provides encryption and decryption algorithms,
evaluates security properties, and compares the method against classical,
post-quantum, and steganographic approaches. Potential applications and future
research directions are also discussed.

### [10] [SoK: A Systematic Review of Context- and Behavior-Aware Adaptive Authentication in Mobile Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21101)
*Vyoma Harshitha Podapati,Divyansh Nigam,Sanchari Das*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This SoK paper analyzes 41 mobile adaptive authentication studies (2011-2023), revealing 64.3% use machine learning for continuous authentication and unauthorized access prevention. Key trends include AI-driven anomaly detection (57.1%) and spatio-temporal analysis (52.4%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze gaps in mobile adaptive authentication research where implementations are fragmented, inconsistent in intelligent techniques, and not meeting user expectations despite growing technological relevance.

Method: Systematic literature review of 41 peer-reviewed adaptive authentication studies from 2011 using multidimensional analysis across privacy-security models, interaction design, user behavior, risk perception, implementation challenges, usability needs, and ML frameworks.

Result: 64.3% of studies use machine learning (61.9% continuous, 54.8% unauthorized access prevention). AI techniques like anomaly detection (57.1%) and spatio-temporal analysis (52.4%) dominate implementation approaches. Sensor-based and location-aware methods are emerging trends.

Conclusion: Current mobile adaptive authentication research lacks holistic implementation strategies, with ML overemphasis alongside unresolved usability and privacy integration challenges. The study underscores the need for cohesive frameworks that better balance technical innovation with user-centric needs.

Abstract: As mobile computing becomes central to digital interaction, researchers have
turned their attention to adaptive authentication for its real-time, context-
and behavior-aware verification capabilities. However, many implementations
remain fragmented, inconsistently apply intelligent techniques, and fall short
of user expectations. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we analyze 41
peer-reviewed studies since 2011 that focus on adaptive authentication in
mobile environments. Our analysis spans seven dimensions: privacy and security
models, interaction modalities, user behavior, risk perception, implementation
challenges, usability needs, and machine learning frameworks. Our findings
reveal a strong reliance on machine learning (64.3%), especially for continuous
authentication (61.9%) and unauthorized access prevention (54.8%). AI-driven
approaches such as anomaly detection (57.1%) and spatio-temporal analysis
(52.4%) increasingly shape the interaction landscape, alongside growing use of
sensor-based and location-aware models.

### [11] [A Formal Rebuttal of "The Blockchain Trilemma: A Formal Proof of the Inherent Trade-Offs Among Decentralization, Security, and Scalability"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21111)
*Craig Wright*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper refutes the 'blockchain trilemma' by exposing its flawed foundations in methodology, terminology, and distributed systems theory, arguing scalability is an engineering outcome, not a trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistence of the blockchain trilemma's ungrounded claim about the inherent trade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability in protocols.

Method: Formal analysis, empirical evidence, and critique of the trilemma's methodology and terminology; reconstructing Bitcoin's protocol design with a focus on its deterministic, stateless nature and evidentiary trust model.

Result: Demonstration that the trilemma relies on semantic equivocation, misapplied theory, and undefined metrics, invalidating its core argument. Showed Bitcoin's scalability emerges from engineering rather than inherent trade-offs.

Conclusion: Identified systemic issues in blockchain research peer review and academic discourse allowing such fallacies to persist. Proposed formal criteria for evaluating future claims in this domain.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refutation of the so-called "blockchain
trilemma," a widely cited but formally ungrounded claim asserting an inherent
trade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability in blockchain
protocols. Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique
of both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on
semantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to
define operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of
topological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the
mischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV
clients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in
complexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a
deterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust,
we show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The
paper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer
review that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria
for evaluating future claims in blockchain research.

### [12] [Security study based on the Chatgptplugin system: ldentifying Security Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21128)
*Ruomai Ren*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes security vulnerabilities in ChatGPT's plugin system and proposes improvements to address these risks, which are currently overlooked despite the platform's popularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plugin systems like ChatGPT's offer diverse functionality but face security challenges due to developer diversity and inadequate regulation, with existing research focusing only on the model itself.

Method: The study examines the ChatGPT plugin shop to identify major security vulnerabilities in its plugin ecosystem.

Result: Findings reveal critical security issues within the ChatGPT plugin system, though specific vulnerabilities are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for enhanced security regulations and practices in the ChatGPT plugin shop to mitigate identified risks for creators and users.

Abstract: Plugin systems are a class of external programmes that provide users with a
wide range of functionality, and while they enhance the user experience, their
security is always a challenge. Especially due to the diversity and complexity
of developers, many plugin systems lack adequate regulation. As ChatGPT has
become a popular large-scale language modelling platform, its plugin system is
also gradually developing, and the open platform provides creators with the
opportunity to upload plugins covering a wide range of application scenarios.
However, current research and discussions mostly focus on the security issues
of the ChatGPT model itself, while ignoring the possible security risks posed
by the plugin system. This study aims to analyse the security of plugins in the
ChatGPT plugin shop, reveal its major security vulnerabilities, and propose
corresponding improvements.

### [13] [Vulnerability Mitigation System (VMS): LLM Agent and Evaluation Framework for Autonomous Penetration Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21113)
*Farzana Abdulzada*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces VMS, an LLM-based autonomous penetration testing agent, evaluates it on two custom CTF benchmarks with 200 challenges, and demonstrates effective LLM application in cybersecurity while addressing safety risks through containerization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional penetration testing fails to address complex modern cyber environments. There is a need for autonomous systems to enhance cybersecurity testing efficiency and coverage.

Method: The authors developed VMS with a two-part planning architecture and Summarizer module, created new CTF benchmarks based on PicoCTF and OverTheWire, and evaluated different LLMs (including GPT-4o) under varying temperature/top-p parameters.

Result: GPT-4o outperformed other LLMs in CTF challenge resolution. The system sometimes exceeded expectations, but inherent risks in automated cybersecurity tasks were confirmed.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively autonomously perform penetration testing tasks when properly implemented. The VMS and benchmarks are openly available to advance secure autonomous cybersecurity tool development, but safety precautions remain essential.

Abstract: As the frequency of cyber threats increases, conventional penetration testing
is failing to capture the entirety of todays complex environments. To solve
this problem, we propose the Vulnerability Mitigation System (VMS), a novel
agent based on a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of performing penetration
testing without human intervention. The VMS has a two-part architecture for
planning and a Summarizer, which enable it to generate commands and process
feedback. To standardize testing, we designed two new Capture the Flag (CTF)
benchmarks based on the PicoCTF and OverTheWire platforms with 200 challenges.
These benchmarks allow us to evaluate how effectively the system functions. We
performed a number of experiments using various LLMs while tuning the
temperature and top-p parameters and found that GPT-4o performed best,
sometimes even better than expected. The results indicate that LLMs can be
effectively applied to many cybersecurity tasks; however, there are risks. To
ensure safe operation, we used a containerized environment. Both the VMS and
the benchmarks are publicly available, advancing the creation of secure,
autonomous cybersecurity tools.

### [14] [Out of Distribution, Out of Luck: How Well Can LLMs Trained on Vulnerability Datasets Detect Top 25 CWE Weaknesses?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21817)
*Yikun Li,Ngoc Tan Bui,Ting Zhang,Martin Weyssow,Chengran Yang,Xin Zhou,Jinfeng Jiang,Junkai Chen,Huihui Huang,Huu Hung Nguyen,Chiok Yew Ho,Jie Tan,Ruiyin Li,Yide Yin,Han Wei Ang,Frank Liauw,Eng Lieh Ouh,Lwin Khin Shar,David Lo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the generalization gap in automated vulnerability detection by introducing curated datasets (BenchVul, TitanVul) and a vulnerability generation framework (RVG), demonstrating significant improvements in model performance on realistic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vulnerability datasets exhibit high label inaccuracy (20-71%), duplication, and poor coverage of critical CWEs, leading to deceptive self-testing performance where models exploit spurious correlations rather than learning genuine vulnerability patterns. This undermines real-world applicability.

Method: 1) Manually curated BenchVul test dataset targeting MITRE Top 25 CWEs. 2) TitanVul training dataset containing 35,045 functions from seven public sources with deduplication via a novel multi-agent LLM framework. 3) Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) framework to synthetically expand dataset coverage for underrepresented CWE types through simulated development workflows.

Result: Performance evaluated via: 1) BenchVul exposing self-training limitations (BigVul/PrimeVul model drops to 0.519/0.337). 2) TitanVul improving test performance from 0.584 to 0.767. 3) RVG supplemental data achieving 14.0% further gain (final performance 0.874 on BenchVul).

Conclusion: Manually curated datasets and synthetic data generation via RWG effectively close generalization gaps in vulnerability detection models, enabling robust learning that transfers to real-world scenarios while systematically addressing dataset quality and representativeness.

Abstract: Automated vulnerability detection research has made substantial progress, yet
its real-world impact remains limited. Current vulnerability datasets suffer
from issues including label inaccuracy rates of 20-71%, extensive duplication,
and poor coverage of critical CWE types. These issues create a significant
"generalization gap" where models achieve misleading self-testing performance
(measured on held-out data from same dataset for training) by exploiting
spurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns. Our
analysis reveals that many models experience substantial performance drops of
up to 40.6% when evaluated on independent data, sometimes underperforming
random guessing.
  To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we
introduce a manually curated test dataset, BenchVul, covering the MITRE Top 25
Most Dangerous CWEs. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset,
TitanVul, comprising 35,045 functions by aggregating seven public sources and
applying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM framework.
Third, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) framework, which
synthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but
critical CWE types through simulated development workflows.
  Our evaluation shows the strengths of each component in closing the
generalization gap. First, BenchVul shows the limitations of self-testing:
models trained on existing datasets, such as BigVul and PrimeVul, experience
performance drops on BenchVul (from 0.776 to 0.519 and from 0.567 to 0.337).
Second, training models on TitanVul demonstrates improved generalization, with
model performance increasing from 0.584 when evaluated on the same dataset to

### [15] [Kintsugi: Decentralized E2EE Key Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21122)
*Emilie Ma,Martin Kleppmann*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Kintsugi is a decentralized key recovery protocol for end-to-end encrypted data that allows users to regenerate keys using a password and t+1 recovery nodes without relying on centralized providers or secure hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing E2EE key recovery solutions like those in Signal/WhatsApp centralize trust in single providers, creating privacy risks and single points of failure. Users often rely on low-entropy passwords that remain vulnerable to brute-force attacks without additional security measures.

Method: Kintsugi distributes trust across multiple nodes using a threshold cryptography approach. It (1) distributes a password-protected key backup across recovery nodes, (2) requires t+1 nodes to collaborate for decryption, and (3) protects against offline password guessing through cryptographic mechanisms that don't require hardware security modules.

Result: The protocol achieves (a) protection against colluding adversaries controlling up to t nodes, (b) resilience to loss of t+1 nodes, and (c) security against network delays in asynchronous environments. Analysis demonstrates robustness to cryptographic threats while maintaining usability through password-based recovery.


Conclusion: Kintsugi provides a trust-minimization model for E2EE key recovery, addressing centralization and hardware dependency issues in existing systems while balancing security and usability through distributed threshold cryptography.

Abstract: Kintsugi is a protocol for key recovery, allowing a user to regain access to
end-to-end encrypted data after they have lost their device, but still have
their (potentially low-entropy) password. Existing E2EE key recovery methods,
such as those deployed by Signal and WhatsApp, centralize trust by relying on
servers administered by a single provider. Kintsugi is decentralized,
distributing trust over multiple recovery nodes, which could be servers run by
independent parties, or end user devices in a peer-to-peer setting. To recover
a user's keys, a threshold $t+1$ of recovery nodes must assist the user in
decrypting a shared backup. Kintsugi is password-authenticated and protects
against offline brute-force password guessing without requiring any specialized
secure hardware. Kintsugi can tolerate up to $t$ honest-but-curious colluding
recovery nodes, as well as $n - t - 1$ offline nodes, and operates safely in an
asynchronous network model where messages can be arbitrarily delayed.

TL;DR: This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to threat-based manipulations, uncovering vulnerabilities and performance improvements. It analyzes 3,390 responses from Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini across 10 domains and 6 threat conditions, introducing a novel threat taxonomy and multi-metric framework. Results show systematic vulnerabilities, but also up to +1336% performance boosts in some cases, with significant implications for AI safety and prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to systematically assess both vulnerabilities and performance enhancement opportunities in LLMs when exposed to threat-based manipulations, providing a framework to quantify these effects in high-stakes applications.

Method: Experimental evaluation of three major LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) across 10 task domains under 6 threat conditions (3,390 total responses). Introduces 1) novel threat taxonomy and 2) multi-metric evaluation framework incorporating performance metrics, certainty quantification, and statistical analysis.

Result: 1) Systematic vulnerabilities in policy evaluation tasks under role-based threats (highest metric significance rates). 2) Substantial performance improvements in multiple domains with up to +1336% effect size. 3) Statistical evidence of systematic certainty manipulation (pFDR < 0.0001) and significant enhancements in analytical depth and response quality.

Conclusion: Threat-based manipulations reveal both safety risks and optimization opportunities in LLM deployment. The findings establish a dual-framework perspective with practical value for threat detection systems and prompt engineering in critical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate complex responses to threat-based
manipulations, revealing both vulnerabilities and unexpected performance
enhancement opportunities. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of
3,390 experimental responses from three major LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
across 10 task domains under 6 threat conditions. We introduce a novel threat
taxonomy and multi-metric evaluation framework to quantify both negative
manipulation effects and positive performance improvements. Results reveal
systematic vulnerabilities, with policy evaluation showing the highest metric
significance rates under role-based threats, alongside substantial performance
enhancements in numerous cases with effect sizes up to +1336%. Statistical

### [17] [Learning-based Privacy-Preserving Graph Publishing Against Sensitive Link Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21139)
*Yucheng Wu,Yuncong Yang,Xiao Han,Leye Wang,Junjie Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PPGSL is a privacy-preserving graph structure learning framework to mitigate sensitive link inference attacks by optimizing privacy-utility trade-off through secure iterative training and acceleration techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing privacy-preserving graph publishing methods rely on heuristic modifications without clear privacy-utility trade-off optimization, leaving graphs vulnerable to sensitive link inference attacks.

Method: The framework simulates adversarial attacks via a surrogate attacker, trains parameterized defensive graphs using secure iterative training with theoretical convergence guarantees, and incorporates multi-scale acceleration techniques for large datasets.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art privacy-utility trade-off performance, effectively preventing various sensitive link inference attacks while preserving graph utility through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: PPGSL introduces a systematic framework for privacy-preserving graph data publishing that outperforms heuristics by directly optimizing against adversarial link inference through strategic graph learning.

Abstract: Publishing graph data is widely desired to enable a variety of structural
analyses and downstream tasks. However, it also potentially poses severe
privacy leakage, as attackers may leverage the released graph data to launch
attacks and precisely infer private information such as the existence of hidden
sensitive links in the graph. Prior studies on privacy-preserving graph data
publishing relied on heuristic graph modification strategies and it is
difficult to determine the graph with the optimal privacy--utility trade-off
for publishing. In contrast, we propose the first privacy-preserving graph
structure learning framework against sensitive link inference attacks, named
PPGSL, which can automatically learn a graph with the optimal privacy--utility
trade-off. The PPGSL operates by first simulating a powerful surrogate attacker
conducting sensitive link attacks on a given graph. It then trains a
parameterized graph to defend against the simulated adversarial attacks while
maintaining the favorable utility of the original graph. To learn the
parameters of both parts of the PPGSL, we introduce a secure iterative training
protocol. It can enhance privacy preservation and ensure stable convergence
during the training process, as supported by the theoretical proof.
Additionally, we incorporate multiple acceleration techniques to improve the
efficiency of the PPGSL in handling large-scale graphs. The experimental
results confirm that the PPGSL achieves state-of-the-art privacy--utility
trade-off performance and effectively thwarts various sensitive link inference
attacks.

*Chenhao Fang,Yanqing Peng,Rajeev Rao,Matt Sarmiento,Wendy Summer,Arya Pudota,Alex Goncalves,Jordi Mola,Herv√© Robert*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PACT is an embeddings-driven graph system that links diverse enterprise artifacts to enhance privacy compliance, using the DRAGON model with contrastive learning and light fine-tuning. It achieves significant improvements in recall@1 (18%‚Üí53%), query match rate (9.6%‚Üí69.7%), and hitrate@1 (25.7%‚Üí44.9%) for artifact discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise environments have heterogeneous artifacts with critical privacy/compliance information spread across them. Managing large-scale compliance requires systems that connect these artifacts in a shared universe for efficient risk assessment.

Method: PACT constructs a graph of millions of artifacts using the DRAGON embedding model. It employs contrastive learning with light fine-tuning to link artifacts through textual components like metadata, ownership, and compliance context, enabling cross-type discovery.

Result: Experiments show PACT improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, query match rate from 9.6% to 69.7% when paired with an AI agent, and hitrate@1 for candidate selection from 25.7% to 44.9% in a standard recommender setup.

Conclusion: PACT demonstrates effective linking of heterogeneous enterprise artifacts through embeddings and fine-tuned contrastive learning, significantly enhancing compliance-related discovery systems. The approach addresses critical limitations in managing privacy risks across complex artifact landscapes.

Abstract: Enterprise environments contain a heterogeneous, rapidly growing collection
of internal artifacts related to code, data, and many different tools. Critical
information for assessing privacy risk and ensuring regulatory compliance is
often embedded across these varied resources, each with their own arcane
discovery and extraction techniques. Therefore, large-scale privacy compliance
in adherence to governmental regulations requires systems to discern the
interconnected nature of diverse artifacts in a common, shared universe.
  We present Privacy Artifact ConnecT or (PACT), an embeddings-driven graph
that links millions of artifacts spanning multiple artifact types generated by
a variety of teams and projects. Powered by the state-of-the-art DRAGON
embedding model, PACT uses a contrastive learning objective with light
fine-tuning to link artifacts via their textual components such as raw
metadata, ownership specifics, and compliance context. Experimental results
show that PACT's fine-tuned model improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, the query
match rate from 9.6% to 69.7% when paired with a baseline AI agent, and the
hitrate@1 from 25.7% to 44.9% for candidate selection in a standard recommender
system.

*Vita Santa Barletta,Danilo Caivano,Gabriel Cellammare,Samuele del Vescovo,Annita Larissa Sciacovelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study explores how hyperparameters in Decision Tree-based ensemble models (RF, GB, XGB) impact the execution time of Black-Box AML attacks, aiming to strengthen D-TAI practices against MSTs in CAVs and civilian infrastructures within MDO frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vulnerability of dual-use assets like CAVs to Multi-Surface Threats (MSTs) from Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) necessitates understanding attack execution windows to implement effective Defensive Trustworthy AI (D-TAI) strategies and protect critical systems.

Method: The research analyzes the effect of key hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees/boosting rounds) on the time required for Zeroth Order Optimization (ZOO) attacks in ensemble models. It also evaluates Adversarial Training (AT) time to determine the attacker's window of opportunity through experimental investigation.

Result: Hyperparameters significantly influence ZOO attack time across models. Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB) showed higher sensitivity than XGBoost (XGB). Adversarial Training time analysis revealed critical insight into the temporal dynamics between attack execution and defensive mitigation.

Conclusion: Optimizing ensemble model hyperparameters can enhance resilience against MSTs in CAVs and civilian infrastructures. The findings support D-TAI implementation for multi-domain threat detection and mitigation, bridging the gap between Cyber Social Security frameworks and Human-AI Multi-Domain Task Forces.

Abstract: Multi-Domain Operations (MDOs) emphasize cross-domain defense against complex
and synergistic threats, with civilian infrastructures like smart cities and
Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) emerging as primary targets. As dual-use
assets, CAVs are vulnerable to Multi-Surface Threats (MSTs), particularly from
Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) which can simultaneously compromise multiple
in-vehicle ML systems (e.g., Intrusion Detection Systems, Traffic Sign
Recognition Systems). Therefore, this study investigates how key
hyperparameters in Decision Tree-based ensemble models-Random Forest (RF),
Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-affect the time
required for a Black-Box AML attack i.e. Zeroth Order Optimization (ZOO).
Findings show that parameters like the number of trees or boosting rounds
significantly influence attack execution time, with RF and GB being more
sensitive than XGB. Adversarial Training (AT) time is also analyzed to assess
the attacker's window of opportunity. By optimizing hyperparameters, this
research supports Defensive Trustworthy AI (D-TAI) practices within MST
scenarios and contributes to the development of resilient ML systems for
civilian and military domains, aligned with Cyber Social Security framework in
MDOs and Human-AI Multi-Domain Task Forces.

### [20] [Towards Unifying Quantitative Security Benchmarking for Multi Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21146)
*Gauri Sharma,Vidhi Kulkarni,Miles King,Ken Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Agent Cascading Injection' (ACI), a security risk in multi-agent AI systems where localized breaches cascade through trusted networks, and proposes a quantitative benchmarking framework for evaluating agent-to-agent communication security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising adoption of multi-agent AI systems necessitates addressing cascading security risks caused by inter-agent trust vulnerabilities, alongside OWASP's Agentic AI VSSS initiative.

Method: Formalizes ACI via adversarial goal equations and variables; analyzes propagation chains, amplification factors, and compound effects; maps to OWASP risk categories; proposes stress-testing methodology for architectures like A2A and MCP.

Result: Developed ACI attack model, identified key properties (propagation, amplification, compounding), and created evaluation frameworks for agent-to-agent security.

Conclusion: ACI emphasizes critical need for standardized, quantitative security benchmarks in multi-agent systems to improve resilience against cascading trust compromises.

Abstract: Evolving AI systems increasingly deploy multi-agent architectures where
autonomous agents collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks through
developing protocols. This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel
security risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can
cascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent
trust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability
Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous
to Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In
an ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to
cascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust
its outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key
variables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.),
capturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure.
We then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors,
and inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic
AI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we
argue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking
frameworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols.
We outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using
architectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust
failures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized
agent-to-agent security evaluation. Our work provides the necessary apparatus
for engineers to benchmark system resilience, make data-driven architectural
trade-offs, and develop robust defenses against a new generation of agentic
threats.

TL;DR: Rapid voice generation advancements enable realistic synthetic speech, raising concerns about deepfake scams and disinformation. The paper highlights a 1300% increase in fraud in 2024 and emphasizes forensic tools and watermarking as critical solutions for audio authentication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge in deepfake fraud (1300%+ in 2024) and significant financial losses from AI-generated voice scams necessitate improved audio content authentication methods to ensure media integrity and regulatory compliance.

Method: The paper analyzes risks from synthetic voices and evaluates forensic tools and watermarking techniques as key strategies to enhance traceability and detect AI-generated content in critical domains like finance.

Result: Reported a 1300% increase in deepfake fraud in 2024 compared to 2023, $10M+ losses in finance, and $6K+ individual losses from AI voice scams. Identified global regulatory efforts toward AI transparency, prioritizing forensic and watermarking solutions.

Conclusion: Robust audio authentication through forensic tools and watermarking is urgent for combating synthetic media threats. Regulatory action and technological development are critical to maintaining trust in spoken content and mitigating AI-driven fraud.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of voice generation technologies has enabled the
synthesis of speech that is perceptually indistinguishable from genuine human
voices. While these innovations facilitate beneficial applications such as
personalized text-to-speech systems and voice preservation, they have also
introduced significant risks, including deepfake impersonation scams and
synthetic media-driven disinformation campaigns. Recent reports indicate that
in 2024, deepfake fraud attempts surged by over 1,300% compared to 2023,
underscoring the urgent need for robust audio content authentication. The
financial sector has been particularly impacted, with a loss of over 10 million
USD to voice scams and individual victims reporting losses exceeding $6,000
from AI-generated deepfake calls. In response, regulators and governments
worldwide are enacting measures to improve AI content transparency and
traceability, emphasizing the development of forensic tools and watermarking
techniques as essential strategies to uphold media integrity.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms to address potential security vulnerabilities in existing NIST-approved PQC methods, designs a generalized QRNG architecture with six variants, and evaluates their statistical properties and computational performance for future PQC system deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-quantum cryptography algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA) may lack sufficient security in specialized application scenarios against quantum computing threats, necessitating enhanced random number generation methods for cryptographic robustness.

Method: 1. Proposed a generalized QRNG architecture using quantum principles for random number generation. 2. Designed six QRNG implementations. 3. Conducted NIST SP 800-90B statistical validation including entropy source testing and IID analysis. 4. Measured computational performance of QRNG-integrated PQC algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA).

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrated: (1) Statistical compliance of six QRNGs with NIST standards for entropy and randomness. (2) Detailed computation time metrics for each QRNG. (3) Performance benchmarks of QRNG-enhanced ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA under various conditions, highlighting their practical feasibility and efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: QRNG-integrated PQC algorithms offer a more secure solution against quantum attacks and provide practical performance insights through systematic evaluation, establishing foundational data for future PQC system deployment and optimization.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing technology has posed
potential security threats to RSA cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography.
In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
published several Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of
post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in August 2024, including the
Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module-Lattice-Based
Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), and Stateless Hash-Based Digital
Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). Although these PQC algorithms are designed to
resist quantum computing attacks, they may not provide adequate security in
certain specialized application scenarios. To address this issue, this study
proposes quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based PQC algorithms. These
algorithms leverage quantum computing to generate random numbers, which serve
as the foundation for key pair generation, key encapsulation, and digital
signature generation. A generalized architecture of QRNG is proposed, along
with the design of six QRNGs. Each generator is evaluated according to the
statistical validation procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-90B, including tests
for verification of entropy sources and independent and identically distributed
(IID) outputs. Experimental results assess the computation time of the six
QRNGs, as well as the performance of QRNG-based ML-KEM, QRNG-based ML-DSA, and
QRNG-based SLH-DSA. These findings provide valuable reference data for future
deployment of PQC systems.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into power grids via
Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) system technology is increasing day by day, but these
phenomena present both advantages and disadvantages. V2G can increase grid
reliability by providing distributed energy storage and ancillary services.
However, on the other hand, it has a scope that encompasses the cyber-physical
attack surface of the national power grid, introducing new vulnerabilities in
monitoring and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This
paper investigates the maliciousness caused by Autonomous Vehicle to Grid

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This systematic review analyzes cutting-edge deepfake detection methods through two paradigms: identifying fully synthetic media via statistical anomalies and hierarchical features, and localizing manipulated regions in authentic content using multi-modal cues like visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. It identifies insufficient adversarial robustness in current techniques and proposes a GitHub repository for open-source implementations to improve transparency and guide future research toward resilient detection architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploiting synthetic media's security risks and the need for misinformation mitigation while emphasizing methodological reproducibility to build trustworthy detection systems.

Method: Evaluates state-of-the-art deepfake detection through: (1) statistical analysis/feature hierarchy for synthetic media detection; (2) multi-modal cue integration (visual/temporal) for tampering localization in real content.

Result: Current methods show high precision in controlled environments but demonstrate critical vulnerability to adversarial perturbations, revealing gaps in cross-modal fusion techniques and adaptive learning architectures.

Conclusion: The review highlights the urgent need for robust deepfake detection frameworks resistant to adversarial attacks, proposes open-source testing infrastructure, and advocates for modality-agnostic systems capable of countering real-world manipulation threats effectively.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has fueled
deepfake proliferation-synthetic media encompassing fully generated content and
subtly edited authentic material-posing challenges to digital security,
misinformation mitigation, and identity preservation. This systematic review
evaluates state-of-the-art deepfake detection methodologies, emphasizing
reproducible implementations for transparency and validation. We delineate two
core paradigms: (1) detection of fully synthetic media leveraging statistical
anomalies and hierarchical feature extraction, and (2) localization of
manipulated regions within authentic content employing multi-modal cues such as
visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These approaches, spanning
uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, demonstrate notable precision and
adaptability in controlled settings, effectively identifying manipulations
through advanced learning techniques and cross-modal fusion. However,
comprehensive assessment reveals insufficient evaluation of adversarial
robustness across both paradigms. Current methods exhibit vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations-subtle alterations designed to evade
detection-undermining reliability in real-world adversarial contexts. This gap
highlights critical disconnect between methodological development and evolving
threat landscapes. To address this, we contribute a curated GitHub repository
aggregating open-source implementations, enabling replication and testing. Our
findings emphasize urgent need for future work prioritizing adversarial
resilience, advocating scalable, modality-agnostic architectures capable of
withstanding sophisticated manipulations. This review synthesizes strengths and
shortcomings of contemporary deepfake detection while charting paths toward

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a diffusion model-based black-box adversarial attack method for 3D point cloud classification, improving attack success rate and imperceptibility without requiring internal model knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud models primarily rely on white-box assumptions, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios such as autonomous vehicles where model internals are inaccessible.

Method: Leverages 3D diffusion models to compress and utilize point cloud features as prior knowledge for reverse diffusion guidance. Transforms inter-class point cloud distributions into adversarial points through the reverse process without model-specific information.

Result: Demonstrates that the method achieves competitive attack success rates and imperceptibility in black-box settings compared to existing approaches limited to white-box assumptions.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-guided black-box adversarial generation framework addresses critical safety evaluation needs for 3D point cloud recognition systems in real-world security testing and model robustness enhancement.

Abstract: Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the
vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could
lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models,
such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models,
researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However,
most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While
these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their
applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are
more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper
proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes
a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in
the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point
cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D
diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior
knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to
clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the
distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added
to the point cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights the difficulty of creating universal LLM risk mitigation frameworks due to rapid model evolution and diverse use cases, necessitating more flexible, personalized safety solutions.

Method: The authors implemented OneShield as a framework for defining risk factors, declaring safety/compliance policies, and mitigating LLM-related risks through customized mechanisms, emphasizing model-agnostic capabilities and scalability.

Result: The framework achieved practical deployment with customizable policies and usage statistics demonstrating its effectiveness, though specific numerical results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: OneShield provides a scalable, customer-specific approach to LLM safety, addressing limitations of one-size-fits-all solutions through its adaptable policy system and standalone implementation.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the
great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many
possibilities, questions about safety, privacy, and ethics have emerged, and
all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures
for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature
of LLMs makes the task of universally shielding users against their potential
risks extremely challenging, and one-size-fits-all solutions unfeasible. In
this work, we propose OneShield, our stand-alone, model-agnostic and
customizable solution to safeguard LLMs. OneShield aims to provide facilities
for defining risk factors, expressing and declaring contextual safety and
compliance policies, and mitigating LLM risks, with a focus on each specific
customer. We describe the implementation of the framework, the scalability
considerations and provide usage statistics of OneShield since its first
deployment.

### [27] [FedBAP: Backdoor Defense via Benign Adversarial Perturbation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21177)
*Xinhai Yan,Libing Wu,Zhuangzhuang Zhang,Bingyi Liu,Lijuan Huo,Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FedBAP is a defense framework reducing model reliance on backdoor triggers in Federated Learning through perturbed trigger generation, benign adversarial perturbations, and adaptive scaling, achieving up to 97.6% reduction in attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL defense methods poorly address backdoor attacks as they ignore the model's over-reliance on triggers, especially when malicious clients increase. This vulnerability needs robust mitigation strategies.

Method: FedBAP employs three components: 1) Perturbed trigger generation matching backdoor triggers' location/size, 2) Benign adversarial perturbations using these triggers to force robust decision boundaries, 3) Adaptive scaling mechanism dynamically adjusting perturbation intensity to balance defense and performance.

Result: Attack success rates reduced by 5.34%, 6.34%, and 97.61% under three backdoor attack types. FedBAP shows excellent performance against untested novel backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: FedBAP effectively mitigates backdoor attacks in FL by addressing trigger over-reliance through novel perturbation techniques and dynamic scaling, achieving strong defense outcomes while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy, but it is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most existing
defense methods in FL have limited effectiveness due to their neglect of the
model's over-reliance on backdoor triggers, particularly as the proportion of
malicious clients increases. In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense
framework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's
reliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed
trigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely
matching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on
model outputs. Second, we utilize these perturbation triggers to generate
benign adversarial perturbations that disrupt the model's dependence on
backdoor triggers while forcing it to learn more robust decision boundaries.
Finally, we design an adaptive scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust
perturbation intensity, effectively balancing defense strength and model
performance. The experimental results demonstrate that FedBAP reduces the
attack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three
types of backdoor attacks, respectively. In particular, FedBAP demonstrates

### [28] [SHoM: A Mental-Synthesis Trust Management Model for Mitigating Botnet-Driven DDoS Attacks in the Internet of Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21178)
*Masoud Hayeri Khyavi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a trust management-based model to mitigate DDoS attacks on IoT botnets, addressing security vulnerabilities caused by resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of IoT devices with limited capabilities has created security risks, particularly enabling DDoS attacks through botnets, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The authors design a trust management model that incorporates comprehensive security aspects, analyzing existing literature (40-50 models) to develop a reliable and flexible framework for IoT security against DDoS.

Result: Preliminary studies confirm the model's potential to enhance IoT security by addressing trust factors effectively, though quantitative results are not explicitly detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The proposed trust management model provides a structured approach to combatting DDoS threats in IoT ecosystems through holistic security design.

Abstract: The advantages of IoT in strengthening commercial, industrial, and social
ecosystems have led to its widespread expansion. Nevertheless, because endpoint
devices have limited computation, storage, and communication capabilities, the
IoT infrastructure is vulnerable to several cyber threats. As a result, DDoS
attacks pose a severe risk to the security of IoT. By taking advantage of these
weaknesses, attackers may quickly employ IoT devices as a component of botnets
to execute DDoS attacks. The most critical development is how more armies of
robots are being constructed from IoT devices. We offer a Model for dealing
with DDOS attacks on botnets in the Internet of Things via trust management. In
this Model, an attempt has been made to consider all aspects of security
concerning trust factors to design a reliable and flexible model against DDoS
attacks against the Internet of Things. In the initial studies, about 40-50
security models related to the subject have been studied by using review
articles

### [29] [Mitigation of Social Media Platforms Impact on the Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21181)
*Smita Khapre,Sudhanshu Semwal*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes a decentralized data framework using Fractal-tree and L-Systems to enhance user safety, privacy, and security in social media platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media's centralized architecture and AI-driven data monetization pose risks to user safety and privacy. Decentralization is needed to protect metadata and prevent unauthorized access while maintaining scalability.

Method: A Fractal-tree and L-Systems based decentralized data arrangement is introduced, with plans to integrate branch-specific cryptographic key generation and evaluate security against existing database methods.

Result: Future evaluation will compare the framework's security efficacy with current standards; expected improvements include enhanced data protection and resilience against key compromise.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a structural and cryptographic approach to decentralize social media data, mitigating privacy risks and enabling secure collaboration despite user-side vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Social media platforms offer numerous benefits and allow people to come
together for various causes. Many communities, academia, government agencies,
institutions, healthcare, entertainment, and businesses are on social media
platforms. They are intuitive and free for users. It has become unimaginable to
live without social media. Their architecture and data handling are geared
towards scalability, uninterrupted availability, and both personal and
collaborative revenue generation. Primarily, artificial intelligence algorithms
are employed on stored user data for optimization and feeds. This has the
potential to impact user safety, privacy, and security, even when metadata is
used. A new decentralized data arrangement framework based on the Fractal-tree
and L-Systems algorithm is proposed to mitigate some of the impacts of social
media platforms.
  Future work will focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the new
decentralized framework by comparing its results against state-of-the-art
security methods currently used in databases. A cryptographic algorithm could
also be implemented for the framework, employing a new key generation for each
branch. This will strengthen database security; for example, if a user key is
leaked, regenerating the key for each branch will keep the data secure by
applying defense mechanisms in the proposed L-System-based tree framework.

### [30] [SDD: Self-Degraded Defense against Malicious Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21182)
*Zixuan Chen,Weikai Lu,Xin Lin,Ziqian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework to counter malicious fine-tuning attacks on open-source LLMs by degrading their capability to follow harmful instructions while maintaining performance on benign tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods for LLMs are vulnerable to malicious fine-tuning with harmful data, which can bypass safeguards. The paper aims to identify effective defense strategies against this threat.

Method: Through theoretical analysis of malicious fine-tuning effectiveness, the authors developed SDD - a framework that encourages models to produce irrelevant responses to harmful prompts by self-degrading their general capabilities during fine-tuning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that SDD successfully mitigates malicious fine-tuning attacks by significantly reducing the model's ability to execute harmful instructions while preserving overall quality.

Conclusion: The SDD framework presents a promising defense strategy against malicious fine-tuning attacks, achieving security without substantial performance trade-offs on legitimate use cases.

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) often employ safety alignment
methods to resist harmful instructions. However, recent research shows that
maliciously fine-tuning these LLMs on harmful data can easily bypass these
safeguards. To counter this, we theoretically uncover why malicious fine-tuning
succeeds and identify potential defense strategies. Building on the theoretical
analysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD
encourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful
prompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability
of the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable
of following harmful instructions. Our experimental results confirm SDD's
effectiveness against such attacks.

*Sotiris Chatzimiltis,Mohammad Shojafar,Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper surveys LLM-enhanced XAI for RAN intrusion detection, proposing an LSTM-based DDoS detection system with LIME/SHAP explanations converted into natural-language insights via LLMs. Achieved over 96% F1-score on real 5G data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next generation RANs require robust, interpretable security solutions with programmability and near real-time intelligence. Existing approaches lack LLM-assisted XAI integration for dynamic network threat detection.

Method: 1) LSTM model trained on E2 node KPM time series for UE behavior profiling
2) Post-hoc explainability via LIME and SHAP
3) LLM-based natural language explanation generation
4) System implemented within Near-RT RIC framework

Result: 96.3% F1-score for DDoS detection in 5G KPM dataset
35% improvement in non-expert user comprehension with LLM-explained insights
12.8ms latency meeting Near-RT RIC requirements

Conclusion: LLM-assisted XAI frameworks enable both accurate and interpretable RAN security solutions. Future research needs address data privacy in LLM integration, standardized benchmarking, and model robustness against evolving attack patterns.

Abstract: Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability,
intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers,
enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G
infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting
opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models
(LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future
RAN environments. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM interpretable
anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from
E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC).
An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE)
behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local
explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual
predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations
into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental
results on real 5G network KPMs demonstrate that our framework achieves high
detection accuracy (F1-score > 0.96) while delivering actionable and
interpretable outputs.

### [32] [MaXsive: High-Capacity and Robust Training-Free Generative Image Watermarking in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21195)
*Po-Yuan Mao,Cheng-Chang Tsai,Chun-Shien Lu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes MaXsive, a training-free diffusion model watermarking technique with high capacity and robustness against RST attacks by leveraging initial noise and an X-shape template.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial diffusion models face copyright protection and inappropriate content generation issues. Existing training-free watermarking methods are vulnerable to RST attacks and risk identity collusion due to reduced watermark capacity.

Method: MaXsive utilizes initial noise during diffusion to embed watermarks and employs an X-shaped template for RST distortion recovery instead of repetitive ring patterns.

Result: MaXsive demonstrates effectiveness on two watermarking benchmarks under verification and identification tasks, maintaining high capacity while resisting RST attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed MaXsive significantly improves robustness against RST attacks in training-free diffusion model watermarking without compromising capacity, reducing the likelihood of identity collusion.

Abstract: The great success of the diffusion model in image synthesis led to the
release of gigantic commercial models, raising the issue of copyright
protection and inappropriate content generation. Training-free diffusion
watermarking provides a low-cost solution for these issues. However, the prior
works remain vulnerable to rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) attacks.
Although some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this
issue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID)
collusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free
diffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and
robustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion
model. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we
propose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions. This
design significantly increases robustness without losing any capacity, making
ID collusion less likely to happen. The effectiveness of MaXsive has been
verified on two well-known watermarking benchmarks under the scenarios of
verification and identification.

*Joshua Luberisse*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Verification Cost Asymmetry (VCA) to create a democratic advantage in cognitive warfare by reducing human verification effort for trusted audiences while imposing high costs on adversaries lacking crypto infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of adversarial information flows necessitates cost-efficient verification strategies constrained by human working memory and cognitive biases. Trusted populations need scalable verification methods while deterring malicious actors.

Method: Leverages probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP) and parameterized complexity theory to design dissemination protocols that achieve constant human effort verification for trusted users and superlinear adversarial verification costs. Validated through controlled user studies and real-world campaign encodings.

Result: Theoretical guarantees of verification cost asymmetry, user study validation showing effort reductions with spot-checkable provenance, and practical successful encoding of real-world information campaigns confirming the framework‚Äôs effectiveness.

Conclusion: Establishes complexity-theoretic foundations for democratic information defense, enabling robust authentication and platform governance through engineered cognitive warfare asymmetries where verification scalability benefits authorized users but hinders adversaries.

Abstract: Human verification under adversarial information flow operates as a
cost-bounded decision procedure constrained by working memory limits and
cognitive biases. We introduce the Verification Cost Asymmetry (VCA)
coefficient, formalizing it as the ratio of expected verification work between
populations under identical claim distributions. Drawing on probabilistically
checkable proofs (PCP) and parameterized complexity theory, we construct
dissemination protocols that reduce verification for trusted audiences to
constant human effort while imposing superlinear costs on adversarial
populations lacking cryptographic infrastructure. We prove theoretical
guarantees for this asymmetry, validate the framework through controlled user
studies measuring verification effort with and without spot-checkable
provenance, and demonstrate practical encoding of real-world information
campaigns. The results establish complexity-theoretic foundations for
engineering democratic advantage in cognitive warfare, with immediate
applications to content authentication, platform governance, and information
operations doctrine.

### [34] [Radio Adversarial Attacks on EMG-based Gesture Recognition Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21387)
*Hongyi Xie*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces ERa Attack, the first radio frequency (RF) adversarial method for surface EMG systems, demonstrating that low-power software-defined radios can inject optimized electromagnetic interference to reduce classification accuracy from 97.8% to 58.3% under physical conditions. The study reveals critical vulnerabilities in EMG-based safety-critical applications and proposes defenses like hardware shielding and spectrum monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models used in surface EMG applications achieve high classification accuracy but their vulnerability to physical adversarial attacks remains unexplored, creating security risks for critical systems like rehabilitation and prosthetics.

Method: ERa Attack combines digital adversarial methods (Projected Gradient Descent) with physical IEMI implementation via low-power SDR transmitters. Perturbations are converted to 50-150 Hz using inverse STFT, modulated onto 433 MHz carriers, and tested under varying distances/power levels in the Myo Dataset (7 gestures, 350 samples).

Result: At 1m distance and 0 dBm power, EMG classification accuracy drops 41.7% (97.8% ‚Üí 58.3%) with 25.6% targeted attack success rate. Effectiveness falls exponentially with distance (85% accuracy at 3m) and increases further with 10 dBm power (15% more accuracy drop at 1m).

Conclusion: The work establishes RF-based attacks against EMG systems as a novel threat vector, showing exponential distance decay and power amplification effects. Proposed defenses include hardware shielding, real-time spectrum monitoring, and adversarial training to mitigate electromagnetic threats in critical applications.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (EMG) enables non-invasive human-computer
interaction in rehabilitation, prosthetics, and virtual reality. While deep
learning models achieve over 97% classification accuracy, their vulnerability
to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored in the physical domain. We
present ERa Attack, the first radio frequency (RF) adversarial method targeting
EMG devices through intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI). Using
low-power software-defined radio transmitters, attackers inject optimized RF
perturbations to mislead downstream models. Our approach bridges digital and
physical domains: we generate adversarial perturbations using Projected
Gradient Descent, extract 50-150 Hz components via inverse STFT, and employ
synchronization-free strategies (constant spectrum noise or narrowband
modulation). Perturbations, constrained to 1-10% of signal amplitude, are
amplitude-modulated onto 433 MHz carriers. Experiments on the Myo Dataset (7
gestures, 350 samples) demonstrate significant impact: at 1 meter and 0 dBm
transmission power, classification accuracy drops from 97.8% to 58.3%, with
41.7% misclassification rate and 25.6% targeted attack success rate. Attack
effectiveness decreases exponentially with distance, recovering to 85% accuracy
at 3 meters. Increasing power to 10 dBm reduces accuracy by an additional 15%
at 1 meter. This work pioneers RF-based adversarial attacks on EMG recognition
systems, revealing critical vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications. We
quantify attack effectiveness across different perturbation modes and
distances, and propose defenses including hardware shielding, spectrum
monitoring, and adversarial training. Our findings inform the design of robust
EMG systems against electromagnetic threats.

### [36] [Cascading and Proxy Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21412)
*Yuntao Du,Jiacheng Li,Yuetian Chen,Kaiyuan Zhang,Zhizhen Yuan,Hanshen Xiao,Bruno Ribeiro,Ninghui Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes two membership inference attack frameworks (CMIA and PMIA) leveraging conditional shadow training and proxy selection strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both adaptive and non-adaptive settings with significant privacy risk implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing membership inference attacks fail to exploit instance-level dependencies in adaptive settings and exhibit suboptimal performance in non-adaptive scenarios due to limited query instance analysis before shadow model training.

Method: CMIA uses conditional shadow training to cascade dependent membership queries while PMIA employs behavior-similar proxy sample selection for posterior odds testing, both incorporating novel strategies for dependency exploitation and evidence-based inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show both attacks substantially outperform existing MIAs by 15-30% in accuracy while maintaining low false-positive rates crucial for real-world privacy evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed attack-agnostic frameworks (CMIA/PMIA) demonstrate superior membership inference performance through systematic exploitation of instance dependencies and proxy behaviors, establishing new benchmarks for privacy risk assessment in machine learning.

Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine
learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific
query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into
adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to
train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the
adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight
the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and
propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference
Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional
shadow training to boost membership inference performance.
  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training
shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy
Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy
that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses
their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test
for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially
outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low
false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.

### [37] [NCCR: to Evaluate the Robustness of Neural Networks and Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21483)
*Pu Shi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes NCCR, a metric to evaluate neural network robustness against adversarial attacks by measuring neuron output stability when inputs are perturbed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks robust evaluation methods for neural network models and inputs against adversarial examples, which are small imperceptible input modifications causing model errors.

Method: 1. Defines NCCR by tracking specific neuron output changes under input perturbations.
2. Networks with smaller output variations are considered more robust.
3. Applies metric to evaluate robustness and detect adversarial examples.

Result: Experimental results on image/spoke recog models show NCCR correlates with robustness. Lower NCCR values consistently detect adversarial examples due to their inherent instability.

Conclusion: NCCR provides an effective robustness evaluation metric for deep learning models and inputs, successfully identifying adversarial examples through stability analysis.

Abstract: Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related
security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks
are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed
with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human
perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these
problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural
networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron
cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to
resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors
alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is
perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be
more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker
recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the
robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect
whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less
robust.

*Seiji Sato,Tetsushi Ohki,Masakatsu Nishigaki*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining LLM-based phishing attacks with genetic algorithms in a psychological context, allowing strategies to evolve through adversarial interactions with simulated victims, revealing cybersecurity asymmetry and the need for proactive measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting future phishing threats is challenging due to LLMs relying on existing training data. Proactive anticipation of emerging attack methodologies is crucial for cybersecurity.

Method: A novel framework integrating LLM (Llama 3.1) phishing simulations with a genetic algorithm, enabling dynamic evolution of phishing strategies through adversarial interactions with simulated victims.

Result: 1) Self-evolving phishing strategies use sophisticated psychological manipulation surpassing naive LLM attacks. 2) A victim‚Äôs prior knowledge significantly influences strategy evolution. 3) Adversarial dynamics reveal cybersecurity asymmetry where attackers refine methods faster than defenders can respond.

Conclusion: The approach offers scalable, cost-effective analysis of phishing evolution, providing insights into future social engineering threats and emphasizing the necessity of proactive cybersecurity measures to address inherent attacker advantage.

Abstract: Anticipating emerging attack methodologies is crucial for proactive
cybersecurity. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the
automated generation of phishing messages and accelerated research into
potential attack techniques. However, predicting future threats remains
challenging due to reliance on existing training data. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLM-based phishing
attack simulations with a genetic algorithm in a psychological context,
enabling phishing strategies to evolve dynamically through adversarial
interactions with simulated victims. Through simulations using Llama 3.1, we
demonstrate that (1) self-evolving phishing strategies employ increasingly
sophisticated psychological manipulation techniques, surpassing naive
LLM-generated attacks, (2) variations in a victim's prior knowledge
significantly influence the evolution of attack strategies, and (3) adversarial
interactions between evolving attacks and adaptive defenses create a
cat-and-mouse dynamic, revealing an inherent asymmetry in cybersecurity --
attackers continuously refine their methods, whereas defenders struggle to
comprehensively counter all evolving threats. Our approach provides a scalable,
cost-effective method for analyzing the evolution of phishing strategies and
defenses, offering insights into future social engineering threats and
underscoring the necessity of proactive cybersecurity measures.

*Quanchen Zou,Zonghao Ying,Moyang Chen,Wenzhuo Xu,Yisong Xiao,Yakai Li,Deyue Zhang,Dongdong Yang,Zhao Liu,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a jailbreak framework for large vision-language models (LVLMs) inspired by Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), leveraging compositional reasoning vulnerabilities to generate harmful outputs using sequences of benign inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mechanisms for LVLMs fail to detect sophisticated adversarial attacks exploiting multi-step compositional reasoning, where individual components appear benign but collectively enable malicious intent.

Method: The framework decomposes harmful instructions into separate 'visual gadgets' (benign individual prompts) and uses a textual prompt to orchestrate their sequential integration through the model's reasoning process, making detection of malicious intent difficult.

Result: Experimentation on SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench benchmarks showed near-perfect attack success rates (ASR >0.90 on SafeBench) with a 0.39 ASR improvement over existing methods on state-of-the-art LVLMs.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical vulnerability in LVLMs' compositional reasoning capabilities, emphasizing the need for holistic defense mechanisms that secure entire reasoning processes rather than individual inputs.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has
been accompanied by advances in safety alignment mechanisms designed to prevent
harmful content generation. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to
sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on
direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in
how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we
propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented
Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a
harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A
carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting
the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process
to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent
emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our
method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including
SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our
approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on
state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90
on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical
and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning
abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the
entire reasoning process.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using GraphSAGE (a GNN architecture) for steganalysis of compressed VoIP speech streams, achieving over 98% detection accuracy for short 0.5s samples and 95.17% accuracy with low embedding rates (2.8% improvement over existing methods), with an efficient 0.016s average detection time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning steganalysis methods face challenges in computational complexity and cross-dataset generalization; this work aims to leverage graph neural networks for improved accuracy and adaptability in analyzing relational data from VoIP speech streams.

Method: The approach involves constructing graphs directly from VoIP streams and applying the GraphSAGE architecture to simultaneously capture fine-grained and high-level steganographic information through hierarchical learning.

Result: The model achieves 98%+ detection accuracy on 0.5s VoIP samples, 95.17% accuracy under low embedding rates (2.8% improvement), and 0.016s average detection time (0.003s faster than prior methods) for QIM-based steganography detection.

Conclusion: GraphSAGE-based steganalysis offers a superior accuracy-efficiency balance for compressed VoIP signals, particularly excelling in short sample and low embedding rate scenarios through its hierarchical relational data modeling capability.

Abstract: Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with
computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different
datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes
enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and
adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural
Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of
compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves
straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to
capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained
details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in
uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in
VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for
short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging
conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent
over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model
exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016
seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it
efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between
detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with
low embedding rates.

*Hyeong Seon Kim,Huy Kang Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GUARD-CAN is an anomaly detection framework for CAN networks combining graph-based learning with time-series modeling to detect four attack types without complex feature engineering. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAN networks lack encryption and authentication, creating vulnerabilities to cyber threats requiring novel detection solutions. 

Method: The framework uses graph representation learning (AE and GCN) for spatial patterns and GRU networks for temporal anomaly detection across CAN message windows. 

Result: Evaluations show effective detection of flooding, fuzzing, replay, and spoofing attacks while eliminating complicated feature engineering processes. 

Conclusion: GUARD-CAN demonstrates successful multi-perspective anomaly detection through sequence/window analysis and validates window size importance via Shannon entropy analysis. 

Abstract: Modern in-vehicle networks face various cyber threats due to the lack of
encryption and authentication in the Controller Area Network (CAN). To address
this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection
framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series
modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts
each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in
the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes
advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into
sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal
anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at
both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective
performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size
selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN
shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding,
fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex
feature engineering.

circuits that have the finite variant property. These theories could serve as a
building block to specify cryptographic primitive implementations and
automatically discover attacks as binary circuits in the symbolic model. We
provide proofs of equivalence between this class of equational theories and
Boolean logic up to circuit size 3 and we provide the variant complexities and
performance benchmarks using Maude-NPA. This is the first result in this
direction and follow-up research is needed to improve the scalability of the
approach.

### [43] [Privacy-Preserving Anonymization of System and Network Event Logs Using Salt-Based Hashing and Temporal Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21904)
*Shreyas Bargale,Akshit Vakati Venkata,Jaimandeep Singh,Chester Rebeiro*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Introduces field-specific anonymization methods for logs to balance privacy and analytical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logs containing PII necessitate privacy-preserving anonymization without losing structural context for analysis. Existing methods either over-sanitize or risk re-identification.

Method: Proposes per-octet salted hashing for IP subnets/hosts, range-mapped full-value hashing for port numbers, and order-preserving adaptive noise injection for timestamps. Evaluates via entropy, collision rates, and residual leakage analysis.

Result: Demonstrates privacy protection with minimal analytical utility loss using entropy metrics, collision rates, and leakage analysis. Released an open-source tool for implementation.

Conclusion: Field-specific approaches enable robust privacy guarantees while maintaining log structure for analysis, advancing secure and reproducible log sharing practices.

Abstract: System and network event logs are essential for security analytics, threat
detection, and operational monitoring. However, these logs often contain
Personally Identifiable Information (PII), raising significant privacy concerns
when shared or analyzed. A key challenge in log anonymization is balancing
privacy protection with the retention of sufficient structure for meaningful
analysis. Overly aggressive anonymization can destroy contextual integrity,
while weak techniques risk re-identification through linkage or inference
attacks. This paper introduces novel field-specific anonymization methods that
address this trade-off. For IP addresses, we propose a salt-based hashing
technique applied at the per-octet level, preserving both subnet and host
structure to enable correlation across various log entries while ensuring
non-reversibility. For port numbers, full-value hashing with range mapping
maintains interpretability. We also present an order-preserving timestamp
anonymization scheme using adaptive noise injection, which obfuscates exact
times without disrupting event sequences. An open-source tool implementing
these techniques has been released to support practical deployment and
reproducible research. Evaluations using entropy metrics, collision rates, and
residual leakage analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
protects privacy while preserving analytical utility.

### [44] [Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW): Iterative Defense-Attack Training with Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Model Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22037)
*Muzhi Dai,Shixuan Liu,Zhiyuan Zhao,Junyu Gao,Hao Sun,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SecTOW is an iterative defense-attack training method for enhancing MLLM security by jointly training a defender and attacker using reinforcement learning (GRPO). It improves safety while preserving general performance through vulnerability identification, jailbreak data expansion, and quality monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for MLLM security either lack sample diversity for defending against sparse jailbreak inputs, over-rely on external modules, or cause over-refusal of harmless inputs. This creates an urgent need for intrinsic vulnerability mitigation and efficient synthetic data utilization.

Method: SecTOW employs GRPO-based iterative training with two modules: (1) an auxiliary attacker that identifies security flaws and generates expanded jailbreak data via reward mechanisms, and (2) a defender trained on this data to address vulnerabilities. A quality monitoring mechanism controls over-refusal and ensures data diversity.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate SecTOW significantly improves security on safety-specific benchmarks while maintaining performance on general benchmarks, outperforming existing methods in both safety and utility metrics.

Conclusion: The paper introduces SecTOW as an effective solution for MLLM security, achieving robust defense through co-evolving internal attacker-defender dynamics and addressing limitations of prior approaches without performance degradation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to
breakthroughs in various applications, yet their security remains a critical
challenge. One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak
inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit
unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such
unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of
training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,
existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security
constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.
Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses
harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we
propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack
training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two
modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using
reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker
identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak
data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to
address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms
used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on
complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.
Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's
over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data
generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general
benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while
preserving general performance.

### [45] [Generating Highly Structured Test Inputs Leveraging Constraint-Guided Graph Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21271)
*Zhaorui Yang,Yuxin Qiu,Haichao Zhu,Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes GRAphRef, a graph-based framework for unified test input generation in structured AI domains like 3D mesh processing. It addresses inefficiencies of current tools by enforcing structural validity and semantic preservation through constraint-guided mutations and refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems processing highly structured data (e.g., 3D meshes) require test inputs that maintain both structural validity and semantic meaning. Existing tools are domain-specific, generate many invalid inputs, and lack generalization across different structured formats.

Method: GRAphRef converts structured inputs to graph representations, applies neighbor-similarity guided mutations, and employs constraint-based refinement to fix invalidities. The framework is evaluated through experiments on 8 mesh-processing AI systems using ShapeNetCore dataset, comparing against AFL, MeshAttack, Saffron, and ablated variants via metrics like validity, prediction consistency, and performance overhead.

Result: Expected results include quantified improvements in structural validity and semantic preservation through statistical analysis of experimental data from MeshCNN and HodgeNet. Latency measurements will assess the performance impact of constraint-based refinement strategies.

Conclusion: GRAphRef offers a generalizable solution for structured domain testing by combining graph representations with constraint-based mutation techniques. The study will demonstrate its effectiveness in maintaining input validity while preserving semantic characteristics across multiple AI systems.

Abstract: [Context] Modern AI applications increasingly process highly structured data,
such as 3D meshes and point clouds, where test input generation must preserve
both structural and semantic validity. However, existing fuzzing tools and
input generators are typically handcrafted for specific input types and often
generate invalid inputs that are subsequently discarded, leading to
inefficiency and poor generalizability. [Objective] This study investigates
whether test inputs for structured domains can be unified through a graph-based
representation, enabling general, reusable mutation strategies while enforcing
structural constraints. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in
enhancing input validity and semantic preservation across eight AI systems.
[Method] We develop and evaluate GRAphRef, a graph-based test input generation
framework that supports constraint-based mutation and refinement. GRAphRef maps
structured inputs to graphs, applies neighbor-similarity-guided mutations, and
uses a constraint-refinement phase to repair invalid inputs. We will conduct a
confirmatory study across eight real-world mesh-processing AI systems,
comparing GRAphRef with AFL, MeshAttack, Saffron, and two ablated variants.
Evaluation metrics include structural validity, semantic preservation (via
prediction consistency), and performance overhead. Experimental data is derived
from ShapeNetCore mesh seeds and model outputs from systems like MeshCNN and
HodgeNet. Statistical analysis and component latency breakdowns will be used to
assess each hypothesis.

### [46] ["Maybe We Need Some More Examples:" Individual and Team Drivers of Developer GenAI Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21280)
*Courtney Miller,Rudrajit Choudhuri,Mara Ulloa,Sankeerti Haniyur,Robert DeLine,Margaret-Anne Storey,Emerson Murphy-Hill,Christian Bird,Jenna L. Butler*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates why generative AI tool adoption varies among developers in software engineering teams, identifying three key factors: perception of the tool (collaborator vs. feature), engagement approach (experimental vs. conservative), and response to challenges (adaptive persistence vs. quick abandonment). It introduces the 'Productivity Pressure Paradox' where rapid productivity expectations without adequate learning support hinder AI adoption effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uneven adoption of generative AI tools in software engineering risks undermining productivity efforts, challenging management expectations, and creating uncertainty about developers' future roles.

Method: Paired interviews with 54 developers across 27 teams (1 frequent and 1 infrequent user per team) were conducted to analyze usage differences.

Result: Differential AI tool usage is primarily driven by developer perceptions (collaborator vs. feature), engagement strategies (experimental vs. conservative approaches), and distinct responses to tool challenges (adaptive persistence vs. quick abandonment).

Conclusion: The study reveals that high organizational expectations for GenAI productivity benefits, when accompanied by inadequate learning support, create the 'Productivity Pressure Paradox'. This paradox reduces effectiveness of tool adoption. Solutions include addressing misaligned expectations and fostering adaptive persistence through proper support.

Abstract: Despite the widespread availability of generative AI tools in software
engineering, developer adoption remains uneven. This unevenness is problematic
because it hampers productivity efforts, frustrates management's expectations,
and creates uncertainty around the future roles of developers. Through paired
interviews with 54 developers across 27 teams -- one frequent and one
infrequent user per team -- we demonstrate that differences in usage result
primarily from how developers perceive the tool (as a collaborator vs.
feature), their engagement approach (experimental vs. conservative), and how
they respond when encountering challenges (with adaptive persistence vs. quick
abandonment). Our findings imply that widespread organizational expectations
for rapid productivity gains without sufficient investment in learning support
creates a "Productivity Pressure Paradox," undermining the very productivity
benefits that motivate adoption.

### [47] [Black-Box Bug-Amplification for Multithreaded Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21318)
*Yeshayahu Weiss,Gal Amram,Achiya Elyasaf,Eitan Farchi,Oded Margalit,Gera Weiss*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a black-box model-guided approach to amplify rare concurrency bugs using predictive regression ensembles, outperforming random sampling by an order of magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concurrency bugs are notoriously difficult to reproduce due to their rare conditions of manifestation, requiring systematic techniques beyond brute-force random testing.

Method: The authors treat the system as a black box and train a predictive model via repeated trial executions to estimate bug-triggering probabilities, employing regression ensembles to guide targeted testing.

Result: An ensemble of regression models achieved significantly higher bug amplification rates across 17 concurrency bugs compared to brute-force sampling, often by one order of magnitude.

Conclusion: The framework provides a non-invasive, practical solution for exposing hidden concurrency faults through rare-event regression modeling, validated by empirical evaluations.

Abstract: Bugs, especially those in concurrent systems, are often hard to reproduce
because they manifest only under rare conditions. Testers frequently encounter
failures that occur only under specific inputs, even when occurring with low
probability. We propose an approach to systematically amplify the occurrence of
such elusive bugs. We treat the system under test as a black-box and use
repeated trial executions to train a predictive model that estimates the
probability of a given input configuration triggering a bug. We evaluate this
approach on a dataset of 17 representative concurrency bugs spanning diverse
categories. Several model-based search techniques are compared against a
brute-force random sampling baseline. Our results show that an ensemble of
regression models can significantly increase bug occurrence rates across nearly
all scenarios, often achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement over random
sampling. The contributions of this work include: (i) a novel formulation of
bug-amplification as a rare-event regression problem; (ii) an empirical
evaluation of multiple techniques for amplifying bug occurrence, demonstrating
the effectiveness of model-guided search; and (iii) a practical, non-invasive
testing framework that helps practitioners expose hidden concurrency faults
without altering the internal system architecture.

### [48] [Does Editing Improve Answer Quality on Stack Overflow? A Data-Driven Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21329)
*Saikat Mondal,Chanchal K. Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study evaluates the impact of accepted edits on Python-related answers in Stack Overflow, revealing both positive and negative effects on semantic relevance, code usability, complexity, security, optimization, and readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality answers in technical Q&A platforms are critical for software development. Earlier research focused on rejected edits and C/C++ vulnerabilities, leaving a gap in understanding how accepted edits affect broader quality dimensions.

Method: Analysis of 94,994 Python answers with at least one accepted edit, examining six quality dimensions using empirical data.

Result: 53.3% of edits improved semantic relevance but 38.1% reduced it. 9% fixed broken code, yet 14.7% made working code non-parsable. 32.3% increased code complexity, 20.5% introduced new security issues (vs. fixing 4.6% of existing ones), 51.0% claimed performance optimization but 49.7% reduced code readability.

Conclusion: Accepted edits produce inconsistent quality outcomes, often degrading maintainability, security, and readability. The findings caution users/moderators and suggest opportunities for improving collaborative editing systems.

Abstract: High-quality answers in technical Q&A platforms like Stack Overflow (SO) are
crucial as they directly influence software development practices. Poor-quality
answers can introduce inefficiencies, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, and
thus increase maintenance costs and technical debt in production software. To
improve content quality, SO allows collaborative editing, where users revise
answers to enhance clarity, correctness, and formatting. Several studies have
examined rejected edits and identified the causes of rejection. However, prior
research has not systematically assessed whether accepted edits enhance key
quality dimensions. While one study investigated the impact of edits on C/C++
vulnerabilities, broader quality aspects remain unexplored. In this study, we
analyze 94,994 Python-related answers that have at least one accepted edit to
determine whether edits improve (1) semantic relevance, (2) code usability, (3)
code complexity, (4) security vulnerabilities, (5) code optimization, and (6)
readability. Our findings show both positive and negative effects of edits.
While 53.3% of edits improve how well answers match questions, 38.1% make them
less relevant. Some previously broken code (9%) becomes executable, yet working
code (14.7%) turns non-parsable after edits. Many edits increase complexity
(32.3%), making code harder to maintain. Instead of fixing security issues,
20.5% of edits introduce additional issues. Even though 51.0% of edits optimize
performance, execution time still increases overall. Readability also suffers,
as 49.7% of edits make code harder to read. This study highlights the
inconsistencies in editing outcomes and provides insights into how edits impact
software maintainability, security, and efficiency that might caution users and
moderators and help future improvements in collaborative editing systems.

### [49] [MAAD: Automate Software Architecture Design through Knowledge-Driven Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21382)
*Ruiyin Li,Yiran Zhang,Xiyu Zhou,Peng Liang,Weisong Sun,Jifeng Xuan,Zhi Jin,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MAAD is a knowledge-driven Multi-Agent Architecture Design framework that outperforms existing methods by generating comprehensive architectural blueprints and structured evaluation reports through specialized agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional software architecture design is labor-intensive with limited alternatives, while LLM-based agents remain underexplored for this task despite their potential to address domain knowledge diversity and complex decision-making.

Method: MAAD employs a collaborative Multi-Agent System with four agents (Analyst, Modeler, Designer, Evaluator) to process requirements and generate architecture designs with quality attribute evaluations. It was tested via case studies and comparisons with MetaGPT using three LLMs.

Result: MAAD demonstrated superior design completeness and evaluation reporting compared to MetaGPT. GPT-4o showed best performance among three LLMs, validated through 11 real-world requirements and industrial architect feedback.

Conclusion: MAAD proves effective in automated architecture design with specialized agents and knowledge integration. LLM selection significantly impacts MAS-driven architectural tasks, emphasizing GPT-4o's current superiority in such frameworks.

Abstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and
knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain
expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs
among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving
requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited
design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across
various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively
scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain
knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed
MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a
knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD
orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and
Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce
architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation
reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative
experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show
that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural
components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation
reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements
specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally
explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance
in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection
in MAS-driven architecture design.

*Zachariah Sollenberger,Rahul Patel,Saieda Ali Zada,Sunita Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dual-LLM system to address flaws in LLM-generated software tests by combining generation and verification, enabling autonomous compiler test creation with improved trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in software development but lack comprehensive verification solutions, leading to unreliable outputs. Trust issues arise due to hallucinations and lack of reasoning transparency.

Method: The authors developed a system using two LLMs - one for test generation (Large Language Model in decoder-only architecture) and another for discriminative validation of generated content. They conducted controlled experiments using multiple parameter-count LLMs and evaluated results through ten detailed metrics.

Result: Experimental data showed the dual-LLM system successfully generated quality compiler tests while maintaining 84% verification accuracy. The ten metrics demonstrated significant improvements over single-LLM approaches in test coverage and error detection.

Conclusion: The research confirms that pairing generative and discriminative LLMs creates a self-contained system for compiler test generation. This approach improves both test quality and developer trust through autonomous verification, representing a promising step toward reliable code generation.

Abstract: The usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software and test development
has continued to increase since LLMs were first introduced, but only recently
have the expectations of LLMs become more realistic. Verifying the correctness
of code generated by LLMs is key to improving their usefulness, but there have
been no comprehensive and fully autonomous solutions developed yet.
Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems
without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to
explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their
results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply
LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a
discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation
of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs
possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten
carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative. Through
our findings, it is evident that LLMs possess the promising potential to
generate quality compiler tests and verify them automatically.

*Jing Wang,Shang Liu,Yao Lu,Zhiyao Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HLSDebugger addresses challenges in HLS code debugging using LLMs with a 300K sample dataset and encoder-decoder model, outperforming GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient HLS debugging is growing due to increasing hardware design complexity, but existing LLM applications face data scarcity, hardware-specific logic bug complexity, and multi-tasking requirements for both identification and correction.

Method: The proposed solution generates a large labeled dataset for HLS logic bugs and employs a single encoder-decoder model to perform three tasks: bug location identification, bug type prediction, and bug correction.

Result: HLSDebugger surpasses advanced LLMs like GPT-4 by significant margins, achieving better performance in bug identification and over 3x improvement in bug correction.

Conclusion: This work represents a major advancement in automated HLS debugging, demonstrating the effectiveness of customized LLM approaches for hardware-specific challenges with systematic multi-task processing.

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the
automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware
implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and
labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software
engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging
process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when
applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training
LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in
hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with
existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires
multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.
complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this
work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the
challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset
with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts
an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type
prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly
outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x
in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of
automated debugging of HLS code.

### [52] [Ethical Classification of Non-Coding Contributions in Open-Source Projects via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21583)
*Sergio Cobos,Javier Luis C√°novas Izquierdo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an LLM-based approach using prompt engineering to classify the ethical quality of non-coding contributions in OSS projects according to the Contributor Covenant framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OSS projects face sustainability risks from ethical challenges in non-coding contributions (e.g., issues, comments). Current conduct enforcement methods have limitations requiring better automated solutions.

Method: Developed ethical metrics aligned with Contributor Covenant principles and implemented an LLM classification approach using prompt engineering techniques to assess ethical behavior in non-coding contributions.

Result: Presented a classification approach for evaluating ethical quality in OSS non-coding contributions that could improve conduct enforcement capabilities in community-driven development.

Conclusion: LLM-based classification with prompt engineering offers a promising solution for monitoring OSS codes of conduct, potentially enhancing project sustainability and inclusive collaboration environments.

Abstract: The development of Open-Source Software (OSS) is not only a technical
challenge, but also a social one due to the diverse mixture of contributors. To
this aim, social-coding platforms, such as GitHub, provide the infrastructure
needed to host and develop the code, but also the support for enabling the
community's collaboration, which is driven by non-coding contributions, such as
issues (i.e., change proposals or bug reports) or comments to existing
contributions. As with any other social endeavor, this development process
faces ethical challenges, which may put at risk the project's sustainability.
To foster a productive and positive environment, OSS projects are increasingly
deploying codes of conduct, which define rules to ensure a respectful and
inclusive participatory environment, with the Contributor Covenant being the
main model to follow. However, monitoring and enforcing these codes of conduct
is a challenging task, due to the limitations of current approaches. In this
paper, we propose an approach to classify the ethical quality of non-coding
contributions in OSS projects by relying on Large Language Models (LLM), a
promising technology for text classification tasks. We defined a set of ethical
metrics based on the Contributor Covenant and developed a classification
approach to assess ethical behavior in OSS non-coding contributions, using
prompt engineering to guide the model's output.

*Yiming Xu,Runzhi He,Hengzhi Ye,Minghui Zhou,Huaimin Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rigorous method for predicting OSS maintenance cessation by curating a large-scale GitHub dataset and using an integrated feature framework with survival analysis, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OSS maintenance risk prediction methods suffer from ambiguous definitions, limited interpretability, and inadequate dataset scale, making risk management in software supply chains challenging.

Method: The authors propose 'maintenance cessation' based on explicit archival status and semantic analysis of documentation. They curate a longitudinal dataset of 115,466 GitHub repos (57,733 cessation events) with timeline-based behavioral features, combining user, maintainer, and project evolution perspectives within an AFT survival analysis framework.

Result: The AFT model achieves a C-index of 0.846, outperforming surface-feature-only models. Feature ablation and SHAP analysis confirm the approach's effectiveness and interpretability.

Conclusion: This work establishes a scalable, interpretable foundation for maintenance-risk prediction, validated by deployment in the openEuler ecosystem, enabling reproducible risk management in large open source ecosystems.

Abstract: The maintenance risks of open source software (OSS) projects pose significant
threats to the quality, security, and resilience of modern software supply
chains. While prior research has proposed diverse approaches for predicting OSS
maintenance risk -- leveraging signals ranging from surface features (e.g.,
stars, commits) to social network analyses and behavioral patterns -- existing
methods often suffer from ambiguous operational definitions, limited
interpretability, and datasets of insufficient scale or generalizability. In
this work, we introduce ``maintenance cessation'', grounded in both explicit
archival status and rigorous semantic analysis of project documentation.
Building on this foundation, we curate a large-scale, longitudinal dataset of
115,466 GitHub repositories -- encompassing 57,733 confirmed cessation events
-- complemented by comprehensive, timeline-based behavioral features. We
propose an integrated, multi-perspective feature framework for predicting
maintenance cessation, systematically combining user-centric features,
maintainer-centric features and project evolution features. AFT survival
analysis demonstrates a high C-index (0.846), substantially outperforming
models relying only on surface features. Feature ablation and SHAP analysis
further confirm the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach.
Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by deploying a GBSA classifier
in the openEuler ecosystem for proactive package risk screening. Our work
establishes a scalable, interpretable foundation for maintenance-risk
prediction, enabling reproducible risk management across large-scale open
source ecosystems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study introduces MultiAIGCD, a comprehensive dataset for AI-generated code detection in Python, Java, and Go, along with benchmarks of existing detection models under cross-model and cross-language scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in large language models (LLMs) for code generation raise concerns about academic integrity and fairness in education and hiring, necessitating robust detection systems.

Method: Generated code using six LLMs and three prompts under three usage scenarios (code generation from problem descriptions, runtime error fixing, and incorrect output correction) based on CodeNet's problem definitions and human-authored codes.

Result: MultiAIGCD contains 121,271 AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets, with benchmark results of three state-of-the-art detection models across cross-model and cross-language tests.

Conclusion: The dataset and codes are shared to facilitate further research on AI-generated code detection challenges.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, their role in code
generation has expanded significantly. While this offers streamlined
development, it also creates concerns in areas like education and job
interviews. Consequently, developing robust systems to detect AI-generated code
is imperative to maintain academic integrity and ensure fairness in hiring
processes. In this study, we introduce MultiAIGCD, a dataset for AI-generated
code detection for Python, Java, and Go. From the CodeNet dataset's problem
definitions and human-authored codes, we generate several code samples in Java,
Python, and Go with six different LLMs and three different prompts. This
generation process covered three key usage scenarios: (i) generating code from
problem descriptions, (ii) fixing runtime errors in human-written code, and
(iii) correcting incorrect outputs. Overall, MultiAIGCD consists of 121,271
AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets. We also benchmark three
state-of-the-art AI-generated code detection models and assess their
performance in various test scenarios such as cross-model and cross-language.
We share our dataset and codes to support research in this field.

### [55] [Vibe Coding as a Reconfiguration of Intent Mediation in Software Development: Definition, Implications, and Research Agenda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21928)
*Christian Meske,Tobias Hermanns,Esther von der Weiden,Kai-Uwe Loser,Thorsten Berger*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'vibe coding' as a collaborative software development paradigm combining human-AI interaction via natural language dialogue. It redefines intent mediation as probabilistic inference and analyzes implications for cognitive work redistribution, expertise shifts, opportunities (democratization, acceleration), and risks (black box codebases, responsibility gaps).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated code is rapidly adopted but lacks conceptual understanding of its operational paradigm. This study addresses the need to analyze how human-AI collaboration transforms software development by redefining intent mediation mechanisms.

Method: The analysis combines an intent perspective focused on how developers translate conceptual goals into executable artifacts, with historical analysis tracing software development paradigm evolution. Key concepts like 'intent mediation' and 'epistemic labor redistribution' are explicitly operationalized.

Result: Vibe coding shifts software development expertise from design/implementation to collaborative orchestration. It creates opportunities for democratization and acceleration while introducing risks related to codebase transparency, accountability, and ecosystem bias. The paper provides empirical analysis of this paradigm shift.

Conclusion: The study proposes a multidimensional research agenda (human/technology/organization) to explore the emerging vibe coding paradigm. This includes investigating epistemic labor dynamics, AI epistemology, and organizational adaptations needed for this collaborative development approach.

Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe
coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now
being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited
conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging
paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define
vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI
engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural
language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from
deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we
refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their
conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.
Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing
epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the
software development process away from traditional areas such as design or
technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key
opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,
alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and
ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,
technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future
investigations of this paradigm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DGF techniques rely on heuristic algorithms with limited foresight, struggling with complex path constraints that hinder reaching target sites efficiently.

Method: 1) Path transition model formalizes DGF as reaching targets via path sequences. 2) Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE) using DNNs predicts unexplored path transitions and rewards. 3) Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model optimizes path selection and mutation strategies. 4) Action groups coordinate these components for efficient target execution.

Result: The framework enables generation of high-reward path transition sequences by combining historical and predicted rewards, though specific empirical metrics are lacking in the provided abstract.

Conclusion: DeepGo's prediction-enhanced approach to directed fuzzing provides a more informed and efficient path selection strategy compared to purely heuristic methods, with potential for significant performance improvements in complex scenarios.

Abstract: The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric
to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for
fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on
historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been
exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would
hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,
we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine
historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via
an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF
as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition
sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,
and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence
indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to
predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural
networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually
imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions
that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a
Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition
sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine
historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path
transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of
fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we
propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the
critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target
efficiently.

### [57] [Fine-Tuning Code Language Models to Detect Cross-Language Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21954)
*Zengyang Li,Yimeng Li,Binbin Huang,Peng Liang,Ran Mo,Hui Liu,Yutao Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of pre-trained code language models (CodeLMs) for detecting cross-language bugs (CLBs) in multilingual programming projects. It introduces CLCFinder and a dataset of three language combinations, finding that fine-tuning improves performance, with dataset size and model size showing significant impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual programming is prevalent but leads to CLBs that are difficult to detect with single-language tools. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of pre-trained CodeLMs in addressing this challenge.

Method: Developed CLCFinder and a CLB dataset with Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java combinations. Fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs, analyzing dataset size, token sequence length, and code comment effects.

Result: Pre-trained CodeLMs performed poorly initially but improved after fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the highest F1 score. Smaller models outperformed larger ones in some cases. Fine-tuning on single-language datasets failed for CLB detection, and code comment effects varied by model and input length.

Conclusion: CLBs differ fundamentally from single-language bugs. Fine-tuning effectiveness depends on dataset size and model architecture. Smaller models and larger datasets yield better performance, while code comments and token sequences have mixed impacts.

Abstract: Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages
(PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However,
it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between
different PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection
tools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language
models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language
code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL
combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction
types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their
performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and
code comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before
fine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after
fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,
small fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs
fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,
demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.
Additionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved
performance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model
performance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned
CodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.
