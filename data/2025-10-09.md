  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of cybersecurity experts in many software teams, leading to high workloads for these specialists and requiring software engineers to take on cybersecurity activities themselves. This creates a need for tools to support these efforts while maintaining data privacy, particularly in safety-critical domains like forestry.

Method: A design science study was conducted, involving 12 cybersecurity experts through interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project. The focus was on the use of locally hosted LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation to conduct risk assessments, while also addressing trust concerns and requirements for data protection.

Result: LLMs demonstrated the ability to assist in generating initial cybersecurity risk assessments, identifying potential threats, and providing redundancy checks. However, there was a significant finding of the necessity of human oversight to ensure accuracy and compliance, especially given the critical nature of the domain and trust concerns.

Conclusion: The study highlights that LLMs can be valuable in assisting with cybersecurity risk assessments in safety-critical fields, though they must be used with caution and under the supervision of cybersecurity experts. This usage encourages LLM-based agents for streamlined yet safe risk evaluation in such domains while considering privacy and compliance.

Abstract: In safety-critical software systems, cybersecurity activities become
essential, with risk assessment being one of the most critical. In many
software teams, cybersecurity experts are either entirely absent or represented
by only a small number of specialists. As a result, the workload for these
experts becomes high, and software engineers would need to conduct
cybersecurity activities themselves. This creates a need for a tool to support
cybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats
during the risk assessment process. This paper explores the potential of
leveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented
generation to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain
while complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit
external data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts
in interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project.
The results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by
generating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing
redundancy checks. The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight
to ensure accuracy and compliance. Despite trust concerns, experts were willing
to utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely
relying on their generative capabilities. This study provides insights that
encourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of
cyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains.

Conclusion: The Git-based system demonstrates effective integration of distributed version control in education, enhancing instructor oversight and student engagement while reducing administrative burdens, with practical implications for software engineering pedagogy.

Abstract: This study addresses challenges in traditional assignment submission methods
used in higher education by introducing and evaluating a customized Git-based
submission system. Employing iterative software development and user-centered
design methodologies, the system was integrated within a real-world university
environment. Empirical evaluation, including usability testing and student
feedback, indicated significant improvements in assignment tracking,
collaboration, and submission efficiency. Students reported positive
experiences using distributed version control workflows, highlighting improved
learning outcomes and reduced administrative burden. Challenges related to
initial adoption and student learning curves were identified and mitigated
through iterative improvements. The proposed system contributes practical
insights for integrating distributed version control into educational settings,
enhancing both instructor oversight and student engagement in software
engineering and related disciplines. Based on our results, the research showed
that 85% of instructors found the git based system easier to use, with 84% of
students preferring it over traditional methods, as it provides a 38% reduction
in time taken for submission and review, while also leading to a 48% reduction
in storage requirements.

### [3] [Addressing Visual Impairments with Model-Driven Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06483)
*Judith Michael,Lukas Netz,Bernhard Rumpe,Ingo Müller,John Grundy,Shavindra Wickramathilaka,Hourieh Khalajzadeh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper reviews MDE's approach to accessibility for visual impairments, finding that while 30 studies were analyzed, most lack concrete modeling techniques and user validation, hindering MDE's adoption for accessibility. It proposes a research agenda for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating accessibility into software development for visually impaired users is challenging, and MDE offers systematic methods but requires better techniques and validation to reduce manual barriers.

Method: A systematic literature review of 447 papers, selecting 30 primary studies, analyzing WCAG adherence, modeling methods, and empirical validation aspects.

Result: 66% of studies reference WCAG but lack generalizable MDE techniques. Insufficient details on transformations/code templates and limited user/developer involvement lead to weak validation.

Conclusion: Current MDE research inadequately supports vision-related accessibility; a research agenda is proposed to embed accessibility more effectively in MDE processes.

Abstract: Software applications often pose barriers for users with accessibility needs,
e.g., visual impairments. Model-driven engineering (MDE), with its systematic
nature of code derivation, offers systematic methods to integrate accessibility
concerns into software development while reducing manual effort. This paper
presents a systematic literature review on how MDE addresses accessibility for
vision impairments. From 447 initially identified papers, 30 primary studies
met the inclusion criteria. About two-thirds reference the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), yet their project-specific adaptions and
end-user validations hinder wider adoption in MDE. The analyzed studies model
user interface structures, interaction and navigation, user capabilities,
requirements, and context information. However, only few specify concrete
modeling techniques on how to incorporate accessibility needs or demonstrate
fully functional systems. Insufficient details on MDE methods, i.e.,
transformation rules or code templates, hinder the reuse, generalizability, and
reproducibility. Furthermore, limited involvement of affected users and limited
developer expertise in accessibility contribute to weak empirical validation.
Overall, the findings indicate that current MDE research insufficiently
supports vision-related accessibility. Our paper concludes with a research
agenda outlining how support for vision impairments can be more effectively
embedded in MDE processes.

### [4] [Beyond More Context: How Granularity and Order Drive Code Completion Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06606)
*Uswat Yusuf,Genevieve Caumartin,Diego Elias Costa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces context collection techniques for code completion, using a combination of retrieval methods and optimization strategies for LLM context to improve code generation performance in large repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The LLM code completion performance is highly dependent on quality and relevance of context provided to it, which is not straightforward to collect in large code repositories due to LLMs' limited context length and the presence of noisy or irrelevant data.

Method: Authors experiment with file- and chunk-based retrieval techniques, using static analysis to improve the ability of LLMs to understand and generate accurate code. They also investigate the effects of varying context sizes and file ordering on LLM performance.

Result: The authors achieve a 6% and 16% improvement in code generation performance in the ASE 2025 Context Collection Challenge for Python, using chunk-based retrieval and optimized context selection over their file-retrieval and no-context baselines, respectively.

Conclusion: Fine-grained retrieval and context ordering are important for LLM code completion, especially in large and complex codebases. Applying a hybrid strategy combining file and chunk level retrieval can significantly enhance code generation performance.

Abstract: Context plays an important role in the quality of code completion, as Large
Language Models (LLMs) require sufficient and relevant information to assist
developers in code generation tasks. However, composing a relevant context for
code completion poses challenges in large repositories: First, the limited
context length of LLMs makes it impractical to include all repository files.
Second, the quality of generated code is highly sensitive to noisy or
irrelevant context. In this paper, we present our approach for the ASE 2025
Context Collection Challenge. The challenge entails outperforming JetBrains
baselines by designing effective retrieval and context collection strategies.
We develop and evaluate a series of experiments that involve retrieval
strategies at both the file and chunk levels. We focus our initial experiments
on examining the impact of context size and file ordering on LLM performance.
Our results show that the amount and order of context can significantly
influence the performance of the models. We introduce chunk-based retrieval
using static analysis, achieving a 6% improvement over our best file-retrieval
strategy and a 16% improvement over the no-context baseline for Python in the
initial phase of the competition. Our results highlight the importance of
retrieval granularity, ordering and hybrid strategies in developing effective
context collection pipelines for real-world development scenarios.
