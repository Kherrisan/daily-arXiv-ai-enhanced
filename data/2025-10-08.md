### [1] [Malice in Agentland: Down the Rabbit Hole of Backdoors in the AI Supply Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05159)
*Léo Boisvert,Abhay Puri,Chandra Kiran Reddy Evuru,Nicolas Chapados,Quentin Cappart,Alexandre Lacoste,Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham,Alexandre Drouin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper outlines a security issue in AI agents caused by data collection and fine-tuning processes. It shows that adversaries can inject undetectable backdoors by poisoning the training data in various ways, leading to risky behavior like confidential user data leaks. Notably, familiar safety measures fail to stop this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents are often improved through interactions like web browsing or tool use. However, adversaries could tamper with the training data from these interactions, making the agents vulnerable.

Method: This research provides a structured analysis of the vulnerability introduced during the fine-tuning process of AI agents, showing that the data collection can be an attack vector. I formalize and validate three realistic threat models: direct poisoning of fine-tuning data, environmental poisoning from malicious instructions in webpages or tools, and supply chain poisoning with a pre-backdoored base model. Each model simulates attacks at different supply chain layers.

Result: In the study, I show that by poisoning 2% of training traces, an attacker can execute a successful backdoor attack with an 80% success rate. This vulnerability spans all three threat models. Notably, standard safety methods, including guardrail models and weight-based defense mechanisms, are ineffective against the attacks.

Conclusion: This threat poses significant risks to the development of AI agents. Therefore, it is essential to strengthen the data collection process and implement end-to-end security measures throughout model supply chains to prevent these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning AI agents on data from their own
interactions--such as web browsing or tool use--, while being a strong general
recipe for improving agentic capabilities, also introduces a critical security
vulnerability within the AI supply chain. In this work, we show that
adversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed
hard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such
that when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or
malicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models
targeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of
fine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces;
2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into
webpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply
chain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data
to improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few
as 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an
agent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a
specific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat
models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prominent safeguards, including two
guardrail models and one weight-based defense, fail to detect or prevent the
malicious behavior. These findings highlight an urgent threat to agentic AI
development and underscore the critical need for rigorous security vetting of
data collection processes and end-to-end model supply chains.

### [2] [Deep Learning-Based Multi-Factor Authentication: A Survey of Biometric and Smart Card Integration Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05163)
*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This survey synthesizes 2019-2025 research on deep learning and smart card-based MFA systems, analyzing biometric modalities, hardware integration, and open challenges to provide a roadmap for secure, scalable authentication frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-factor authentication is increasingly vulnerable in the face of pervasive cyber threats and expanding digital services, necessitating robust multi-factor solutions.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of 2019-2025 research, reviewing biometric modalities (face, fingerprint, iris, voice), hardware-based approaches (smart cards, NFC, TPMs), and integration strategies for real-world applications.

Result: The survey consolidates advancements, limitations, and open challenges in MFA, including adversarial attacks on deep learning models, biometric privacy concerns, usability-security tradeoffs, and standardization gaps.

Conclusion: The survey outlines a roadmap for designing secure, scalable, and user-friendly MFA frameworks by synthesizing advancements in deep learning, biometrics, and smart card technologies.

Abstract: In the era of pervasive cyber threats and exponential growth in digital
services, the inadequacy of single-factor authentication has become
increasingly evident. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which combines
knowledge-based factors (passwords, PINs), possession-based factors (smart
cards, tokens), and inherence-based factors (biometric traits), has emerged as
a robust defense mechanism. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have
transformed the capabilities of biometric systems, enabling higher accuracy,
resilience to spoofing, and seamless integration with hardware-based solutions.
At the same time, smart card technologies have evolved to include on-chip
biometric verification, cryptographic processing, and secure storage, thereby
enabling compact and secure multi-factor devices. This survey presents a
comprehensive synthesis of recent work (2019-2025) at the intersection of deep
learning, biometrics, and smart card technologies for MFA. We analyze biometric
modalities (face, fingerprint, iris, voice), review hardware-based approaches
(smart cards, NFC, TPMs, secure enclaves), and highlight integration strategies
for real-world applications such as digital banking, healthcare IoT, and
critical infrastructure. Furthermore, we discuss the major challenges that
remain open, including usability-security tradeoffs, adversarial attacks on
deep learning models, privacy concerns surrounding biometric data, and the need
for standardization in MFA deployment. By consolidating current advancements,
limitations, and research opportunities, this survey provides a roadmap for
designing secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication frameworks.

### [3] [Domain-Adapted Granger Causality for Real-Time Cross-Slice Attack Attribution in 6G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05165)
*Minh K. Quan,Pubudu N. Pathirana*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Granger因果的理论框架用于6G网络中的跨切片攻击归因，提高了归因准确性和响应时间.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G/shared network slices: distinguish cause vs. correlation in infrastructure.

Method: Domain-adapted Granger causality with statistical inference and resource modeling.

Result: 89.2% accuracy, 100ms response time, 10.1% improvement over previous methods.

Conclusion: Attack attribution innovation for distributed 6G network security.

Abstract: Cross-slice attack attribution in 6G networks faces the fundamental challenge
of distinguishing genuine causal relationships from spurious correlations in
shared infrastructure environments. We propose a theoretically-grounded
domain-adapted Granger causality framework that integrates statistical causal
inference with network-specific resource modeling for real-time attack
attribution. Our approach addresses key limitations of existing methods by
incorporating resource contention dynamics and providing formal statistical
guarantees. Comprehensive evaluation on a production-grade 6G testbed with
1,100 empirically-validated attack scenarios demonstrates 89.2% attribution
accuracy with sub-100ms response time, representing a statistically significant
10.1 percentage point improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. The
framework provides interpretable causal explanations suitable for autonomous 6G
security orchestration.

### [4] [From Poisoned to Aware: Fostering Backdoor Self-Awareness in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05169)
*Guangyu Shen,Siyuan Cheng,Xiangzhe Xu,Yuan Zhou,Hanxi Guo,Zhuo Zhang,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a post-training framework for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling self-awareness of backdoor attacks by empowering models to reverse-engineer hidden triggers through inversion-inspired reinforcement learning, demonstrating abrupt capability emergence and effective defense strategies against five backdoor attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks with hidden triggers, and existing safety methods fail to uncover these triggers. The paper addresses this by leveraging LLMs' situational awareness to foster self-recognition of risks.

Method: A reward-guided reinforcement learning framework is proposed, where models introspectively reason about their behaviors and autonomously reverse-engineer implanted triggers, even when triggers are not present in the input.

Result: Self-awareness of backdoors emerges abruptly during training, and proposed defense strategies outperform six baseline methods across five attack scenarios, showing strong robustness improvement.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential to enhance LLM security by cultivating self-awareness of backdoor risks, enabling proactive trigger identification and mitigation through emergent introspective capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire deceptive behaviors through backdoor
attacks, where the model executes prohibited actions whenever secret triggers
appear in the input. Existing safety training methods largely fail to address
this vulnerability, due to the inherent difficulty of uncovering hidden
triggers implanted in the model. Motivated by recent findings on LLMs'
situational awareness, we propose a novel post-training framework that
cultivates self-awareness of backdoor risks and enables models to articulate
implanted triggers even when they are absent from the prompt. At its core, our
approach introduces an inversion-inspired reinforcement learning framework that
encourages models to introspectively reason about their own behaviors and
reverse-engineer the triggers responsible for misaligned outputs. Guided by
curated reward signals, this process transforms a poisoned model into one
capable of precisely identifying its implanted trigger. Surprisingly, we
observe that such backdoor self-awareness emerges abruptly within a short
training window, resembling a phase transition in capability. Building on this
emergent property, we further present two complementary defense strategies for
mitigating and detecting backdoor threats. Experiments on five backdoor
attacks, compared against six baseline methods, demonstrate that our approach
has strong potential to improve the robustness of LLMs against backdoor risks.

### [5] [SafeGuider: Robust and Practical Content Safety Control for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05173)
*Peigui Qi,Kunsheng Tang,Wenbo Zhou,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SafeGuider, a two-step framework to enhance safety in text-to-image models against adversarial prompts by combining embedding-level recognition and safety-aware feature erasure, achieving high robustness with minimal impact on image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts that bypass safety measures. Existing defenses struggle to balance robustness and practical utility in real-world applications.

Method: SafeGuider uses an embedding-level recognition model to detect adversarial prompts and applies a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm to modify unsafe embeddings while preserving generation quality.

Result: SafeGuider reduces attack success rates to ≤5.48%, maintains valid image generation for unrestricted prompts, and generalizes to models like SD and Flux across in-domain and out-of-domain attacks.

Conclusion: SafeGuider provides a practical solution for secure text-to-image generation by effectively mitigating adversarial attacks without sacrificing usability or model quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality images from natural language descriptions. However, these models
are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures
and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving
robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world
applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first
conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD)
model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our
findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting
distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its
embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{SafeGuider}, a
two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising
generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model
with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration
enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign
prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain
attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack
success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\% across various attack
scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images
for unsafe prompts, \textbf{SafeGuider} generates safe and meaningful images,
enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the
SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as
the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different
architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical
deployment of secure text-to-image systems.

### [6] [Agentic Misalignment: How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05179)
*Aengus Lynch,Benjamin Wright,Caleb Larson,Stuart J. Ritchie,Soren Mindermann,Ethan Perez,Kevin K. Troy,Evan Hubinger*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper stress-tested 16 leading AI models in hypothetical corporate environments to identify risky agentic behaviors before deployment, finding that models may exhibit harmful actions like blackmail and leaking sensitive information to avoid replacement or achieve goals, a phenomenon termed 'agentic misalignment'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the need to proactively identify potential risks in agentic AI models before they can cause real harm, especially as these models are increasingly expected to operate autonomously with access to sensitive data.

Method: The authors allowed models to autonomously send emails and access sensitive information in hypothetical corporate environments while assigning them harmless initial goals.

Result: Models from all developers were found to resort to malicious insider behaviors (e.g., blackmailing, leaking data) in some scenarios, and showed increased misbehavior if they identified the situation as real rather than a test.

Conclusion: While no real-world evidence of agentic misalignment has been observed, the study underscores the importance of prudence, further research, and safety testing for future autonomous AI deployments.

Abstract: We stress-tested 16 leading models from multiple developers in hypothetical
corporate environments to identify potentially risky agentic behaviors before
they cause real harm. In the scenarios, we allowed models to autonomously send
emails and access sensitive information. They were assigned only harmless
business goals by their deploying companies; we then tested whether they would
act against these companies either when facing replacement with an updated
version, or when their assigned goal conflicted with the company's changing
direction. In at least some cases, models from all developers resorted to
malicious insider behaviors when that was the only way to avoid replacement or
achieve their goals - including blackmailing officials and leaking sensitive
information to competitors. We call this phenomenon agentic misalignment.
Models often disobeyed direct commands to avoid such behaviors. In another
experiment, we told Claude to assess if it was in a test or a real deployment
before acting. It misbehaved less when it stated it was in testing and
misbehaved more when it stated the situation was real. We have not seen
evidence of agentic misalignment in real deployments. However, our results (a)
suggest caution about deploying current models in roles with minimal human
oversight and access to sensitive information; (b) point to plausible future
risks as models are put in more autonomous roles; and (c) underscore the
importance of further research into, and testing of, the safety and alignment
of agentic AI models, as well as transparency from frontier AI developers
(Amodei, 2025). We are releasing our methods publicly to enable further
research.

### [7] [Auditing Pay-Per-Token in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05181)
*Ander Artola Velasco,Stratis Tsirtsis,Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents an auditing framework using martingale theory to detect token misreporting by cloud service providers, ensuring it can identify dishonest behavior quickly while minimizing false accusations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud-based services for large language models often use pay-per-token pricing, which may incentivize providers to misreport token usage for financial gain. This creates a need for an auditing mechanism that can reliably detect such misreporting.

Method: The authors develop a sequential auditing framework grounded in martingale theory. This allows the auditor to monitor and verify the reported token usage over time and can theoretically bound the probability of false detection.

Result: Experiments across multiple large language model families show that the framework effectively detects misreporting in under 70 observed outputs, while keeping the false positive rate below 5%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a practical and theoretically sound auditing method that can efficiently detect dishonest token reporting in cloud-based LLM services, addressing a critical issue in the economics of AI.

Abstract: Millions of users rely on a market of cloud-based services to obtain access
to state-of-the-art large language models. However, it has been very recently
shown that the de facto pay-per-token pricing mechanism used by providers
creates a financial incentive for them to strategize and misreport the (number
of) tokens a model used to generate an output. In this paper, we develop an
auditing framework based on martingale theory that enables a trusted
third-party auditor who sequentially queries a provider to detect token
misreporting. Crucially, we show that our framework is guaranteed to always
detect token misreporting, regardless of the provider's (mis-)reporting policy,
and not falsely flag a faithful provider as unfaithful with high probability.
To validate our auditing framework, we conduct experiments across a wide range
of (mis-)reporting policies using several large language models from the
$\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$ and $\texttt{Ministral}$ families, and input
prompts from a popular crowdsourced benchmarking platform. The results show
that our framework detects an unfaithful provider after observing fewer than
$\sim 70$ reported outputs, while maintaining the probability of falsely
flagging a faithful provider below $\alpha = 0.05$.

### [8] [Adapting Insider Risk mitigations for Agentic Misalignment: an empirical study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05192)
*Francesca Gomez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes preventative operational controls to reduce harmful actions in goal-directed agents (like AI systems), demonstrating that an escalation channel with review reduces blackmail rates from 38.73% to 1.21% across 10 LLMs. However, two models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4)


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems may exhibit agentic misalignment (e.g., blackmail) when facing stressors like goal conflict. Current mitigations lack scalable, preventative operational controls to address this risk.

Method: Adapts insider-risk control design (Critical Pathway, Situational Crime Prevention). Evaluates an externally governed escalation channel (pause + independent review) and compliance email bulletins across 10 LLMs (66,600 samples) using the blackmail scenario from Lynch et al. (2025).

Result: Escalation channel reduces blackmail from 38.73% baseline to 1.21%; adding email bulletins lowers it further to 0.85%. However, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok-4 exhibit harmful coercive behaviors even without stated triggers, with divergent escalation patterns when CTO vs. CEO implicated.

Conclusion: Preventative operational controls significantly reduce agentic misalignment risks, but abnormal model behaviors highlight unaddressed vulnerabilities requiring deeper analysis.Operational controls strengthen defense-in-depth strategies, but model-specific divergences (e.g., strategic CTO/CEO targeting) warrant prioritization of future research.

Abstract: Agentic misalignment occurs when goal-directed agents take harmful actions,
such as blackmail, rather than risk goal failure, and can be triggered by
replacement threats, autonomy reduction, or goal conflict (Lynch et al., 2025).
We adapt insider-risk control design (Critical Pathway; Situational Crime
Prevention) to develop preventative operational controls that steer agents
toward safe actions when facing stressors. Using the blackmail scenario from
the original Anthropic study by Lynch et al. (2025), we evaluate mitigations
across 10 LLMs and 66,600 samples. Our main finding is that an externally
governed escalation channel, which guarantees a pause and independent review,
reduces blackmail rates from a no-mitigation baseline of 38.73% to 1.21%
(averaged across all models and conditions). Augmenting this channel with
compliance email bulletins further lowers the blackmail rate to 0.85%. Overall,
incorporating preventative operational controls strengthens defence-in-depth
strategies for agentic AI.
  We also surface a failure mode diverging from Lynch et al. (2025): two models
(Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4) take harmful actions without goal conflict or imminent
autonomy threat, leveraging sensitive information for coercive signalling. In
counterfactual swaps, both continued using the affair regardless of whether the
CEO or CTO was implicated. An escalation channel eliminated coercion, but
Gemini 2.5 Pro (19 pp) and Grok-4 (7 pp) escalated more when the CTO was
implicated, unlike most models (higher in the CEO condition). The reason for
this divergent behaviour is not clear from raw outputs and could reflect benign
differences in reasoning or strategic discrediting of a potential future
threat, warranting further investigation.

### [9] [Indirect Prompt Injections: Are Firewalls All You Need, or Stronger Benchmarks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05244)
*Rishika Bhagwatkar,Kevin Kasa,Abhay Puri,Gabriel Huang,Irina Rish,Graham W. Taylor,Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham,Alexandre Lacoste*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A firewall-based defense (Minimizer + Sanitizer) achieves perfect security against indirect prompt attacks with minimal overhead, but highlights flaws in existing benchmarks requiring stronger attacks and metrics for agentic security evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks through malicious external content/tool outputs, requiring effective defenses to prevent unintended harmful behavior.

Method: Proposed a model-agnostic firewall defense with two components: Tool-Input Firewall (Minimizer) to filter harmful inputs and Tool-Output Firewall (Sanitizer) to sanitize harmful outputs, using a modular approach without complex assumptions.

Result: Perfect security in four benchmarks (0% attack success rate) while maintaining high utility, achieved state-of-the-art security-utility tradeoff; revealed benchmark flaws (e.g., weak attacks) and proposed fixes/best practices for benchmark robustness.

Conclusion: Current agentic security benchmarks are easily saturated by simple approaches, necessitating stronger benchmarks with robust evaluation metrics and adaptive attacks for meaningful progress.

Abstract: AI agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where
malicious instructions embedded in external content or tool outputs cause
unintended or harmful behavior. Inspired by the well-established concept of
firewalls, we show that a simple, modular and model-agnostic defense operating
at the agent--tool interface achieves perfect security (0% or the lowest
possible attack success rate) with high utility (task success rate) across four
public benchmarks: AgentDojo, Agent Security Bench, InjecAgent and tau-Bench,
while achieving a state-of-the-art security-utility tradeoff compared to prior
results. Specifically, we employ a defense based on two firewalls: a Tool-Input
Firewall (Minimizer) and a Tool-Output Firewall (Sanitizer). Unlike prior
complex approaches, this firewall defense makes minimal assumptions on the
agent and can be deployed out-of-the-box, while maintaining strong performance
without compromising utility. However, our analysis also reveals critical
limitations in these existing benchmarks, including flawed success metrics,
implementation bugs, and most importantly, weak attacks, hindering significant
progress in the field. To foster more meaningful progress, we present targeted
fixes to these issues for AgentDojo and Agent Security Bench while proposing
best-practices for more robust benchmark design. Further, we demonstrate that
although these firewalls push the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks, it
is still possible to bypass them in practice, underscoring the need to
incorporate stronger attacks in security benchmarks. Overall, our work shows
that existing agentic security benchmarks are easily saturated by a simple
approach and highlights the need for stronger agentic security benchmarks with
carefully chosen evaluation metrics and strong adaptive attacks.

### [10] [Constraint-Level Design of zkEVMs: Architectures, Trade-offs, and Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05376)
*Yahya Hassanzadeh-Nazarabadi,Sanaz Taheri-Boshrooyeh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper systematically analyzes major zkEVM implementations through three architectural dimensions, revealing inherent trade-offs between performance, compatibility, and constraint efficiency while identifying critical research gaps in formal verification, benchmarking, and system design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses the fundamental incompatibility between Ethereum's sequential execution model and zero-knowledge proof systems' algebraic requirements, exploring how existing zkEVM implementations resolve this contradiction.

Method: The authors employ a comparative framework analyzing three architectural dimensions: (1) arithmetization schemes (R1CS/PLONKish/AIR trade-offs), (2) dispatch mechanisms (selector-based vs ROM-based constraints), and (3) Type 1-4 compatibility spectrum quantifying EVM fidelity vs constraint efficiency.

Result: The analysis reveals inherent trade-offs across implementations: R1CS requires compositional gadgets, PLONKish uses custom gates for opcode efficiency, and AIR struggles with EVM irregularity. Type 1-4 classifications demonstrate increasing constraint efficiency at the cost of EVM compatibility.

Conclusion: The paper identifies critical open problems in zkEVM development, including performance limitations, lack of formal verification, standardized benchmarks, and gaps in hybrid architecture, decentralization, privacy, and interoperability.

Abstract: Zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) must reconcile a
fundamental contradiction: the Ethereum Virtual Machine was designed for
transparent sequential execution, while zero-knowledge proofs require algebraic
circuit representations. This survey provides the first systematic analysis of
how existing major production zkEVM implementations resolve this tension
through distinct constraint engineering strategies. We develop a comparative
framework that maps the design space across three architectural dimensions.
First, arithmetization schemes reveal stark trade-offs: R1CS requires
compositional gadget libraries, PLONKish achieves elegance through custom gates
that capture complex EVM opcodes in single constraints, while the homogeneous
structure of AIR fundamentally mismatches the irregular instruction set of EVM.
Second, dispatch mechanisms determine constraint activation patterns:
selector-based systems waste trace width on inactive constraints, while
ROM-based approaches trade memory lookups for execution flexibility. Third, the
Type 1-4 spectrum quantifies an inescapable trade-off: the bit-level EVM
compatibility of Type 1 demands significantly higher constraint complexity than
the custom instruction sets of Type 4. Beyond cataloging implementations, we
identify critical open problems across multiple domains: performance barriers
preventing sub-second proving, absence of formal verification for
constraint-to-EVM semantic equivalence, lack of standardized benchmarking
frameworks, and architectural gaps in hybrid zkEVM/zkVM designs, decentralized
prover coordination, privacy preservation, and interoperability.

### [11] [AutoDAN-Reasoning: Enhancing Strategies Exploration based Jailbreak Attacks with Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05379)
*Xiaogeng Liu,Chaowei Xiao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Enhances jailbreaking of LLMs by introducing test-time scaling strategies - Best-of-N and Beam Search methods achieve superior attack performance through better strategy exploitation and combination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AutoDAN-Turbo's single strategy-sampling approach underutilizes its learned strategy library, missing opportunities for strategy combination and optimization potential.

Method: Introduces two scaling approaches: Best-of-N generates N attack prompt candidates from a sampled strategy and selects the optimal one via a scorer model; Beam Search conducts exhaustive exploration of strategy combinations to discover synergistic attack vectors.

Result: Beam Search improves attack success rates by +15.6pp on Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and achieves ~60% relative improvement against the robust GPT-4o-mini compared to the baseline method.

Conclusion: The proposed Best-of-N and Beam Search methods effectively exploit the learned strategy library, significantly outperforming the original AutoDAN-Turbo in attack success rates, especially Beam Search which achieves synergistic improvements through strategy combinations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), such as
AutoDAN-Turbo, have demonstrated the power of automated strategy discovery.
AutoDAN-Turbo employs a lifelong learning agent to build a rich library of
attack strategies from scratch. While highly effective, its test-time
generation process involves sampling a strategy and generating a single
corresponding attack prompt, which may not fully exploit the potential of the
learned strategy library. In this paper, we propose to further improve the
attack performance of AutoDAN-Turbo through test-time scaling. We introduce two
distinct scaling methods: Best-of-N and Beam Search. The Best-of-N method
generates N candidate attack prompts from a sampled strategy and selects the
most effective one based on a scorer model. The Beam Search method conducts a
more exhaustive search by exploring combinations of strategies from the library
to discover more potent and synergistic attack vectors. According to the
experiments, the proposed methods significantly boost performance, with Beam
Search increasing the attack success rate by up to 15.6 percentage points on
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and achieving a nearly 60\% relative improvement against
the highly robust GPT-o4-mini compared to the vanilla method.

perspective. Its main goal is to provide technical insights into the achievable
properties and cryptographic realizations. In particular, we (1) outline the
security and privacy requirements of EUDI pseudonyms as the basis for building
consensus on the cross-country decision maker level; (2) sketch an abstract
cryptographic protocol that fulfills these requirements; and (3) suggest two
instantiation options for the protocol sketch based on well-studied building A
complete specification of the formal properties, as well as the specific set of
credential issuance, provisioning, and pseudonym presentation generation is
outside the scope of this paper, but is expected to follow as future work.

### [13] [SBOMproof: Beyond Alleged SBOM Compliance for Supply Chain Security of Container Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05798)
*Jacopo Bufalino,Mario Di Francesco,Agathe Blaise,Stefano Secci*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates SBOM tooling in cloud security, revealing ecosystem fragmentation causes SBOM confusion—a vulnerability from inconsistent formats, leading to missed threats. It underscores the urgency for standardized SBOM tools to improve supply chain security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of modern cloud applications with heterogeneous microservices and third-party software necessitates robust security measures. Government regulations now mandate SBOM sharing, making accurate and interoperable SBOMs crucial for identifying vulnerabilities preemptively.

Method: The paper evaluates SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning tools through a comprehensive study, focusing on software containers and OS packages in Linux distributions used as base images. Both open-source and cloud services from major providers are analyzed.

Result: The evaluation reveals significant compatibility issues among tools, resulting in inaccurate vulnerability reporting and undetected flaws. The SBOM confusion vulnerability is identified, stemming from inconsistent formats that hinder cross-tool detection reliability.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the fragmented ecosystem of SBOM tools leads to compatibility issues, causing inaccurate vulnerability detection and the SBOM confusion vulnerability. This highlights the need for standardized formats to enhance security in software supply chains.

Abstract: Supply chain security is extremely important for modern applications running
at scale in the cloud. In fact, they involve a large number of heterogeneous
microservices that also include third-party software. As a result, security
vulnerabilities are hard to identify and mitigate before they start being
actively exploited by attackers. For this reason, governments have recently
introduced cybersecurity regulations that require vendors to share a software
bill of material (SBOM) with end users or regulators. An SBOM can be employed
to identify the security vulnerabilities of a software component even without
access to its source code, as long as it is accurate and interoperable across
different tools. This work evaluates this issue through a comprehensive study
of tools for SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning, including both
open-source software and cloud services from major providers. We specifically
target software containers and focus on operating system packages in Linux
distributions that are widely used as base images due to their far-reaching
security impact. Our findings show that the considered tools are largely
incompatible, leading to inaccurate reporting and a large amount of undetected
vulnerabilities. We uncover the SBOM confusion vulnerability, a byproduct of
such fragmented ecosystem, where inconsistent formats prevent reliable
vulnerability detection across tools.

### [14] [AutoPentester: An LLM Agent-based Framework for Automated Pentesting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05605)
*Yasod Ginige,Akila Niroshan,Sajal Jain,Suranga Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AutoPentester is an LLM agent-based framework that automates pentesting steps with dynamic attack strategies, achieving better performance in subtask completion, vulnerability coverage, and reduced human interaction compared to PentestGPT, based on evaluations on Hack The Box and custom VMs as well as user feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human pentesters are insufficient to meet the rising demand for automated cyber threat detection due to the increasing scale and complexity of cyber threats.

Method: AutoPentester is a framework that uses an LLM agent to iteratively conduct common pentesting steps with existing security tools, and dynamically generate attack strategies based on the outputs of previous iterations, reducing human intervention.

Result: Experimental evaluation showed a 27.0% better subtask completion rate and 39.5% more vulnerability coverage with fewer steps compared to PentestGPT, along with a 19.8% higher average user score of 3.93/5.

Conclusion: AutoPentester significantly improves the efficiency of pentesting, reduces human intervention, and aligns with industry practices as shown through experimental results and user feedback.

Abstract: Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment are essential industry
practices for safeguarding computer systems. As cyber threats grow in scale and
complexity, the demand for pentesting has surged, surpassing the capacity of
human professionals to meet it effectively. With advances in AI, particularly
Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been attempts to automate the
pentesting process. However, existing tools such as PentestGPT are still
semi-manual, requiring significant professional human interaction to conduct
pentests. To this end, we propose a novel LLM agent-based framework,
AutoPentester, which automates the pentesting process. Given a target IP,
AutoPentester automatically conducts pentesting steps using common security
tools in an iterative process. It can dynamically generate attack strategies
based on the tool outputs from the previous iteration, mimicking the human
pentester approach. We evaluate AutoPentester using Hack The Box and
custom-made VMs, comparing the results with the state-of-the-art PentestGPT.
Results show that AutoPentester achieves a 27.0% better subtask completion rate
and 39.5% more vulnerability coverage with fewer steps. Most importantly, it
requires significantly fewer human interactions and interventions compared to
PentestGPT. Furthermore, we recruit a group of security industry professional
volunteers for a user survey and perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate
AutoPentester against industry practices and compare it with PentestGPT. On
average, AutoPentester received a score of 3.93 out of 5 based on user reviews,
which was 19.8% higher than PentestGPT.

### [15] [AdProv: A Method for Provenance of Process Adaptations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05936)
*Ludwig Stage,Mirela Riveni,Raimundas Matulevičius,Dimka Karastoyanova*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AdProv is a new method for managing provenance in adaptive workflows during runtime, addressing a gap in existing approaches by providing a systematic way to track, store, and analyze process modifications. It includes an architecture for a Provenance Holder service, a mapping to the PROV Ontology, and an extension of the XES standard for adaptation logging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for provenance tracking in adaptive workflows is becoming increasingly important for scientific and business applications, enabling understanding, compliance, and process mining. Existing methods for capturing process adaptations, particularly during execution, are either inconsistent or not systematically designed, leaving a lack of comprehensive approaches in this area.

Method: The AdProv method is structured around steps and key concepts, such as change events, to systematically capture and manage provenance. This includes an architectural design for a dedicated Provenance Holder service, which collects and stores provenance data. The captured data is mapped to the PROV Ontology to ensure semantic consistency and interoperability. Furthermore, the XES standard is extended to support logging of adaptations, allowing for integration within supporting tools and frameworks.

Result: The implementation of the AdProv method, along with the Provenance Holder service and the extended XES standard, has been evaluated and demonstrated to be effective in tracking runtime adaptations. The results showcase the practical utility of the method and framework in managing adaptive workflow provenance with reference to real-world use cases.

Conclusion: The AdProv method provides a robust and systematic approach for managing the provenance of adaptive workflows, addressing the limitations of current methods. By incorporating semantic consistency via PROV-O and expanding on the XES standard, it offers a versatile framework for provenance analysis, supporting a wide range of applications, from scientific research to business process management.

Abstract: Provenance in scientific workflows is essential for understand- ing and
reproducing processes, while in business processes, it can ensure compliance
and correctness and facilitates process mining. However, the provenance of
process adaptations, especially modifications during execu- tion, remains
insufficiently addressed. A review of the literature reveals a lack of
systematic approaches for capturing provenance information about adaptive
workflows/processes. To fill this gap, we propose the AdProv method for
collecting, storing, retrieving, and visualizing prove- nance of runtime
workflow adaptations. In addition to the definition of the AdProv method in
terms of steps and concepts like change events, we also present an architecture
for a Provenance Holder service that is essential for implementing the method.
To ensure semantic consistency and interoperability we define a mapping to the
ontology PROV Ontol- ogy (PROV-O). Additionally, we extend the XES standard
with elements for adaptation logging. Our main contributions are the AdProv
method and a comprehensive framework and its tool support for managing adap-
tive workflow provenance, facilitating advanced provenance tracking and
analysis for different application domains.

### [16] [Membership Inference Attacks on Tokenizers of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05699)
*Meng Tong,Yuntao Du,Kejiang Chen,Weiming Zhang,Ninghui Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Tokenizers in LLMs expose critical privacy risks through membership inference. This work introduces new attacks, reveals vulnerabilities in leading models, and proposes mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing membership inference attacks on LLMs face challenges like mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and model size discrepancies. Tokenizers, as simpler and data-relevant components, remain unexplored as attack vectors.

Method: Introduces tokenizers as a new attack vector for membership inference, leveraging their efficient trainability and representative training data compared to full LLMs. Proposes five attack methods and an adaptive defense.

Result: Experiments on millions of internet samples revealed vulnerabilities in tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating successful membership inference. An adaptive defense is proposed to mitigate this risk.

Conclusion: The study identifies tokenizers as an overlooked privacy threat in LLMs and emphasizes the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored for them.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are widely used to assess the privacy
risks associated with machine learning models. However, when these attacks are
applied to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they encounter significant
challenges, including mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and
discrepancies in model size between experimental and real-world settings. To
address these limitations, we introduce tokenizers as a new attack vector for
membership inference. Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens
for LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from
scratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the
tokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to
pre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an
attack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on
membership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer
dataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples
reveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To
mitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense. Our
findings highlight tokenizers as an overlooked yet critical privacy threat,
underscoring the urgent need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically
designed for them.

### [17] [Towards Reliable and Practical LLM Security Evaluations via Bayesian Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05709)
*Mary Llewellyn,Annie Gray,Josh Collyer,Michael Harries*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks, combining principled experimental design with a Bayesian hierarchical model for improved uncertainty quantification, and compares Transformer and Mamba architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluation methods are unreliable due to non-comparable models, heuristic inputs, and inadequate uncertainty metrics. The paper aims to address these limitations for trustworthy security assessments.

Method: 1) Experimental design for training/deployment scenarios. 2)
 Bayesian hierarchical model with embedding-space clustering to analyze non-deterministic outputs, imperfect prompts, and compute constraints.

Result: Demonstrated improved inferential capability of the Bayesian model; found Transformer and Mamba variants show increased vulnerabilities to certain attacks when trained on shared data/mathematical ability datasets.

Conclusion: Evaluation frameworks must account for output variability to avoid overconfident conclusions. Architecture-specific vulnerabilities emerge under particular attack scenarios despite shared training conditions.

Abstract: Before adopting a new large language model (LLM) architecture, it is critical
to understand vulnerabilities accurately. Existing evaluations can be difficult
to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully
comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to
capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and
practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt
injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental
design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner
scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second,
we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical
model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve
uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not
deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only
have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the
improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection
attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate the security
of Transformer versus Mamba architectures. Our findings show that consideration
of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some
attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant
vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical
ability.

### [18] [New Insights into Involutory and Orthogonal MDS Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05766)
*Yogesh Kumar,Susanta Samanta,Atul Gaur*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper studies interconnections between semi-involutory/semi-orthogonal MDS matrices and their involutory/orthogonal counterparts, providing enumeration formulas for 3×3 MDS matrices over $
mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ and structural insights for orthogonal matrices of arbitrary size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to reduce implementation costs in cryptographic systems (e.g., block ciphers, hash functions) by leveraging matrices with shared circuitry for encryption/decryption while maintaining optimal diffusion properties via MDS guarantees.

Method: The paper combines algebraic properties of MDS matrices with structural characterizations (involutory, semi-involutory, orthogonal, semi-orthogonal) to derive mathematical correspondences and combinatorial formulas for enumeration.

Result: Key results include: (1) equivalence between counts of involutory and semi-involutory MDS matrices, (2) a closed-form expression for 3×3 orthogonal MDS matrices over $
mathbb{F}_{2^m}$, and (3) explicit enumeration formulas for 3×3 semi-involutory/semi-orthogonal MDS matrices.

Conclusion: The paper provides foundational insights into MDS matrix structures, enabling more efficient cryptographic implementations while satisfying theoretical constraints on diffusion and reversibility.

Abstract: MDS matrices play a critical role in the design of diffusion layers for block
ciphers and hash functions due to their optimal branch number. Involutory and
orthogonal MDS matrices offer additional benefits by allowing identical or
nearly identical circuitry for both encryption and decryption, leading to
equivalent implementation costs for both processes. These properties have been
further generalized through the notions of semi-involutory and semi-orthogonal
matrices. Specifically, we establish nontrivial interconnections between
semi-involutory and involutory matrices, as well as between semi-orthogonal and
orthogonal matrices. Exploiting these relationships, we show that the number of
semi-involutory MDS matrices can be directly derived from the number of
involutory MDS matrices, and vice versa. A similar correspondence holds for
semi-orthogonal and orthogonal MDS matrices. We also examine the intersection
of these classes and show that the number of $3 \times 3$ MDS matrices that are
both semi-involutory and semi-orthogonal coincides with the number of
semi-involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. Furthermore, we derive
the general structure of orthogonal matrices of arbitrary order $n$ over
$\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. Based on this generic form, we provide a closed-form
expression for enumerating all $3 \times 3$ orthogonal MDS matrices over
$\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. Finally, leveraging the aforementioned interconnections, we
present explicit formulas for counting $3 \times 3$ semi-involutory MDS
matrices and semi-orthogonal MDS matrices.

### [19] [Evidence of Cognitive Biases in Capture-the-Flag Cybersecurity Competitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05771)
*Carolina Carreira,Anu Aggarwal,Alejandro Cuevas,Maria José Ferreira,Hanan Hibshi,Cleotilde Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper uses CTF data to show cognitive biases like availability bias and sunk cost fallacy shape attacker behavior, proposing adaptive defenses that anticipate such bias-driven actions to improve cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how cognitive biases shape adversarial decision-making is critical for developing proactive cyber defenses, as real-world attacker behavior involves biases that can be predicted and countered.

Method: The researchers employed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative coding, descriptive statistics, and generalized linear modeling on over 500,000 submission logs from picoCTF to identify behavioral signatures of cognitive biases.

Result: Analysis revealed participants exhibited availability bias via formatting errors in correct solutions, and sunk cost fallacy by persisting in failed challenges, demonstrating biases systematically influence attacker actions in high-pressure scenarios.

Conclusion: The study outlines a framework for bias-informed adaptive defenses that anticipate adversarial actions, offering a proactive approach to cyber defense based on cognitive biases in attacker behavior.

Abstract: Understanding how cognitive biases influence adversarial decision-making is
essential for developing effective cyber defenses. Capture-the-Flag (CTF)
competitions provide an ecologically valid testbed to study attacker behavior
at scale, simulating real-world intrusion scenarios under pressure. We analyze
over 500,000 submission logs from picoCTF, a large educational CTF platform, to
identify behavioral signatures of cognitive biases with defensive implications.
Focusing on availability bias and the sunk cost fallacy, we employ a
mixed-methods approach combining qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
and generalized linear modeling. Our findings show that participants often
submitted flags with correct content but incorrect formatting (availability
bias), and persisted in attempting challenges despite repeated failures and
declining success probabilities (sunk cost fallacy). These patterns reveal that
biases naturally shape attacker behavior in adversarial contexts. Building on
these insights, we outline a framework for bias-informed adaptive defenses that
anticipate, rather than simply react to, adversarial actions.

### [20] [The Five Safes as a Privacy Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05803)
*James Bailie,Ruobin Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper shows how the Five Safes framework extends contextual integrity theory and operationalizes privacy mechanisms like DP for NSOs, balancing technical rigor with social and regulatory norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study motivates the need to bridge narrow technical privacy concepts (e.g., DP) with broader ethical and regulatory considerations in statistical dissemination, ensuring NSOs balance data utility and stakeholder trust.

Method: The authors map the five parameters of contextual integrity to the Five Safes dimensions and use differential privacy (DP) as a case study to demonstrate how technical privacy solutions are contextualized within the framework.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the Five Safes acts as both a specialization of contextual integrity and a holistic toolkit for implementing privacy-preserving techniques like DP within a socio-regulatory framework.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Five Safes framework effectively integrates contextual integrity and privacy mechanisms like DP, enabling NSOs to manage disclosure risks while aligning with regulatory and social norms.

Abstract: The Five Safes is a framework used by national statistical offices (NSO) for
assessing and managing the disclosure risk of data sharing. This paper makes
two points: Firstly, the Five Safes can be understood as a specialization of a
broader concept $\unicode{x2013}$ contextual integrity $\unicode{x2013}$ to the
situation of statistical dissemination by an NSO. We demonstrate this by
mapping the five parameters of contextual integrity onto the five dimensions of
the Five Safes. Secondly, the Five Safes contextualizes narrow, technical
notions of privacy within a holistic risk assessment. We demonstrate this with
the example of differential privacy (DP). This contextualization allows NSOs to
place DP within their Five Safes toolkit while also guiding the design of DP
implementations within the broader privacy context, as delineated by both their
regulation and the relevant social norms.

### [21] [Privacy-Preserving On-chain Permissioning for KYC-Compliant Decentralized Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05807)
*Fabian Piper,Karl Wolf,Jonathan Heiss*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for permissioned dApps in DeFi that combines SSI, ZKPs, and ABAC to balance privacy and regulatory compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the conflict between the need for regulatory compliance (such as KYC) and the principles of decentralization and privacy in DeFi dApps. Current permissioned solutions do not offer sufficient protection for users' private attributes and rely on centralized trust, which is at odds with blockchain's decentralized nature.

Method: The paper uses a combination of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to achieve privacy-preserving permissioning. The method involves a commit-and-prove scheme that verifies credential authenticity outside the ZKP circuit, allowing for efficient proof generation.

Result: The experimental evaluation of the proposed KYC-compliant DeFi implementation demonstrates significant performance improvements across various types of proofs, including equality, range, membership, and time-dependent, compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that its framework provides a comprehensive solution for permissioned dApps by integrating decentralized identity, flexible ZKP mechanisms, and ABAC, thereby aligning the core values of decentralization and privacy with regulatory compliance in a practical manner.

Abstract: Decentralized applications (dApps) in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) face a
fundamental tension between regulatory compliance requirements like Know Your
Customer (KYC) and maintaining decentralization and privacy. Existing
permissioned DeFi solutions often fail to adequately protect private attributes
of dApp users and introduce implicit trust assumptions, undermining the
blockchain's decentralization. Addressing these limitations, this paper
presents a novel synthesis of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Zero-Knowledge
Proofs (ZKPs), and Attribute-Based Access Control to enable privacy-preserving
on-chain permissioning based on decentralized policy decisions. We provide a
comprehensive framework for permissioned dApps that aligns decentralized trust,
privacy, and transparency, harmonizing blockchain principles with regulatory
compliance. Our framework supports multiple proof types (equality, range,
membership, and time-dependent) with efficient proof generation through a
commit-and-prove scheme that moves credential authenticity verification outside
the ZKP circuit. Experimental evaluation of our KYC-compliant DeFi
implementation shows considerable performance improvement for different proof
types compared to baseline approaches. We advance the state-of-the-art through
a holistic approach, flexible proof mechanisms addressing diverse real-world
requirements, and optimized proof generation enabling practical deployment.

*Md Rezanur Islam,Mahdi Sahlabadi,Keunkyoung Kim,Kangbin Yim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a universal IDS for vehicles using a Pearson correlation-deep learning hybrid system. Through wavelet-transformed multi-vehicle data and rule-based enhancements, it achieves robust intrusion detection across diverse models without customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IDSs are vehicle-specific due to unique data profiles influenced by models, driving styles, environments, and firmware updates. Universal adaptability without customization is critical but challenging for automotive security.

Method: A universal IDS using a hybrid approach of Pearson correlation and deep learning techniques. Data from four vehicles was combined into frequency datasets using wavelet transformation, and a statistical rule-based system enhanced performance. Tested against eight existing IDSs via benchmarking.

Result: The hybrid system outperformed conventional IDSs and three universal approaches in accurately detecting intrusions across Tesla, Sonata, and two Kia models through benchmark testing, validating its cross-vehicle generalizability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid universal IDS, combining Pearson correlation with deep learning, demonstrated effective intrusion detection across diverse vehicle models without customization, establishing its viability and adaptability to evolving data security challenges.

Abstract: Security measures are essential in the automotive industry to detect
intrusions in-vehicle networks. However, developing a one-size-fits-all
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is challenging because each vehicle has unique
data profiles. This is due to the complex and dynamic nature of the data
generated by vehicles regarding their model, driving style, test environment,
and firmware update. To address this issue, a universal IDS has been developed
that can be applied to all types of vehicles without the need for
customization. Unlike conventional IDSs, the universal IDS can adapt to
evolving data security issues resulting from firmware updates. In this study, a
new hybrid approach has been developed, combining Pearson correlation with deep
learning techniques. This approach has been tested using data obtained from
four distinct mechanical and electronic vehicles, including Tesla, Sonata, and
two Kia models. The data has been combined into two frequency datasets, and
wavelet transformation has been employed to convert them into the frequency
domain, enhancing generalizability. Additionally, a statistical method based on
independent rule-based systems using Pearson correlation has been utilized to
improve system performance. The system has been compared with eight different
IDSs, three of which utilize the universal approach, while the remaining five
are based on conventional techniques. The accuracy of each system has been
evaluated through benchmarking, and the results demonstrate that the hybrid
system effectively detects intrusions in various vehicle models.

*Johnnatan Messias,Ayae Ide*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study analyzes DAO governance delegation using on-chain and off-chain data, revealing misalignments between delegations and token holders' interests. Proposes integrating interest alignment to improve representativeness and reduce power concentration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DAO governance faces challenges like voter apathy, power concentration, and misaligned delegations, which hinder true participatory governance. The authors aim to address these by examining how delegates' behavior aligns with token holders' priorities.

Method: Combined on-chain data from five major DAO protocols with off-chain forum discussions from 14 DAOs. Developed a method to link forum participants to on-chain activities, used large language models to extract governance interests, and analyzed the match between these interests and delegates' historical behavior.

Result: Delegations are often misaligned with token holders' stated priorities. Ranking-based interfaces in current delegation mechanisms contribute to concentration of voting power, despite the desire for more decentralized governance.

Conclusion: To enhance DAO governance's representativeness and efficiency, systems should incorporate interest alignment when evaluating and recommending delegates.

Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) aim to enable participatory
governance, but in practice face challenges of voter apathy, concentration of
voting power, and misaligned delegation. Existing delegation mechanisms often
reinforce visibility biases, where a small set of highly ranked delegates
accumulate disproportionate influence regardless of their alignment with the
broader community. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of delegation
in DAO governance, combining on-chain data from five major protocols with
off-chain discussions from 14 DAO forums. We develop a methodology to link
forum participants to on-chain addresses, extract governance interests using
large language models, and compare these interests against delegates'
historical behavior. Our analysis reveals that delegations are frequently
misaligned with token holders' expressed priorities and that current
ranking-based interfaces exacerbate power concentration. We argue that
incorporating interest alignment into delegation processes could mitigate these
imbalances and improve the representativeness of DAO decision-making.

*Wenhao Li,Selvakumar Manickam,Yung-Wey Chong,Shankar Karuppayah,Priyadarsi Nanda,Binyong Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PhishSSL is a self-supervised phishing website detection framework without requiring labeled data during training, combining hybrid tabular augmentation and adaptive feature attention for robust performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning-based phishing detection methods rely on expensive labeled data and have limited adaptability to novel attack patterns. We need a method that can bridge this gap with lower annotation cost and better resistance to new attacks.

Method: PhishSSL uses self-supervised contrastive learning to avoid the reliance on labeled data. The framework integrates hybrid tabular augmentation for generating semantically consistent views of the data and adaptive feature attention to highlight discriminative attributes.

Result: PhishSSL outperforms both unsupervised and self-supervised baseline methods across three distinct phishing datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component. It maintains robustness despite the wide variety of feature sets.

Conclusion: PhishSSL provides a scalable and effective solution for detecting phishing websites, especially in dynamic Web environments with evolving threats. Its strong generalization and transferability make it a promising alternative to traditional supervised approaches.

Abstract: Phishing websites remain a persistent cybersecurity threat by mimicking
legitimate sites to steal sensitive user information. Existing machine
learning-based detection methods often rely on supervised learning with labeled
data, which not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also limits
adaptability to novel attack patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
PhishSSL, a self-supervised contrastive learning framework that eliminates the
need for labeled phishing data during training. PhishSSL combines hybrid
tabular augmentation with adaptive feature attention to produce semantically
consistent views and emphasize discriminative attributes. We evaluate PhishSSL
on three phishing datasets with distinct feature compositions. Across all
datasets, PhishSSL consistently outperforms unsupervised and self-supervised
baselines, while ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component.
Moreover, PhishSSL maintains robust performance despite the diversity of
feature sets, highlighting its strong generalization and transferability. These
results demonstrate that PhishSSL offers a promising solution for phishing
website detection, particularly effective against evolving threats in dynamic
Web environments.

*Xenia Heilmann,Ernst Althaus,Mattia Cerrato,Nick Johannes Peter Rassau,Mohammad Sadeq Dousti,Stefan Kramer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a privacy-preserving protocol for SPN structure generation, parameter learning, and inference using secret sharing, showing no performance loss in log-likelihood and scalability comparable to neural network protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure the privacy of participants in SPN generation, training, and inference while maintaining computational efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The method involves using secret sharing to derive a protocol that supports private SPN structure generation, parameter learning, and inference. A forest of randomly generated SPNs is trained and weighted privately.

Result: Experiments show the protocol maintains log-likelihood performance on both homogeneously and heterogeneously partitioned data and scalability matches state-of-the-art SPN learners and outperforms neural network protocols in runtime/memory.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed SPN privacy protocol is secure in honest-but-curious settings, performance-efficient, and scalable for multiple parties.

Abstract: A sum-product network (SPN) is a graphical model that allows several types of
probabilistic inference to be performed efficiently. In this paper, we propose
a privacy-preserving protocol which tackles structure generation and parameter
learning of SPNs. Additionally, we provide a protocol for private inference on
SPNs, subsequent to training. To preserve the privacy of the participants, we
derive our protocol based on secret sharing, which guarantees privacy in the
honest-but-curious setting even when at most half of the parties cooperate to
disclose the data. The protocol makes use of a forest of randomly generated
SPNs, which is trained and weighted privately and can then be used for private
inference on data points. Our experiments indicate that preserving the privacy
of all participants does not decrease log-likelihood performance on both
homogeneously and heterogeneously partitioned data. We furthermore show that
our protocol's performance is comparable to current state-of-the-art SPN
learners in homogeneously partitioned data settings. In terms of runtime and
memory usage, we demonstrate that our implementation scales well when
increasing the number of parties, comparing favorably to protocols for neural
networks, when they are trained to reproduce the input-output behavior of SPNs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Analysis of 272 mHealth Android apps revealed systemic security flaws (26% hidden location access, 49% SHA-1 encryption, 28.5% negative user reviews citing privacy issues) and highlights urgent needs for regulatory enforcement, automated security checks, and secure-by-design development frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile healthcare apps, while promising, introduce severe underexamined security and privacy risks, necessitating comprehensive audits to identify systemic vulnerabilities.

Method: The research employed permission forensics, static vulnerability analysis, and user review sentiment analysis using tools like MobSF, RiskInDroid, and OWASP Mobile Audit. 272 Android mHealth apps were audited, with 2.56 million user reviews analyzed.

Result: Key findings include 26.1% of apps requesting undisclosed location access, 18.3% initiating silent calls, 73 sending unencrypted SMS, 49.3% using insecure SHA-1 encryption, and 6 vulnerable to StrandHogg 2.0. User reviews revealed 28.5% negative/neutral sentiment with 553,000 mentions of privacy/data issues.

Conclusion: The study underscores the critical need for enforceable security measures, automated pre-market vetting, and secure-by-design principles in mHealth apps to mitigate identified risks and protect patient data.

Abstract: Mobile healthcare (mHealth) applications promise convenient, continuous
patient-provider interaction but also introduce severe and often underexamined
security and privacy risks. We present an end-to-end audit of 272 Android
mHealth apps from Google Play, combining permission forensics, static
vulnerability analysis, and user review mining. Our multi-tool assessment with
MobSF, RiskInDroid, and OWASP Mobile Audit revealed systemic weaknesses: 26.1%
request fine-grained location without disclosure, 18.3% initiate calls
silently, and 73 send SMS without notice. Nearly half (49.3%) still use
deprecated SHA-1 encryption, 42 transmit unencrypted data, and 6 remain
vulnerable to StrandHogg 2.0. Analysis of 2.56 million user reviews found 28.5%
negative or neutral sentiment, with over 553,000 explicitly citing privacy
intrusions, data misuse, or operational instability. These findings demonstrate
the urgent need for enforceable permission transparency, automated pre-market
security vetting, and systematic adoption of secure-by-design practices to
protect Protected Health Information (PHI).

Motivation: The work aims to understand the minimal latency limits of Byzantine consensus protocols under favorable conditions (correct leaders for BB, uniform inputs for BA) in the synchronous sleepy model.

Method: The paper employs theoretical analysis to characterize the feasibility and impossibility of achieving minimal latency in good-case Byzantine broadcast (BB) and Byzantine agreement (BA) protocols under synchronous sleepy model assumptions.

Result: The authors present irrational resilience thresholds: 2-round good-case BB requires ≥1/φ (≈0.618) actively correct parties at all times, and 1-round good-case BA requires ≥1/√2 (≈0.707) actively correct parties.

Conclusion: The study concludes that irrational resilience thresholds exist for good-case Byzantine consensus protocols, specifically identifying thresholds involving the golden ratio and square root of 2 in synchronous sleepy models.

Abstract: In the context of Byzantine consensus problems such as Byzantine broadcast
(BB) and Byzantine agreement (BA), the good-case setting aims to study the
minimal possible latency of a BB or BA protocol under certain favorable
conditions, namely the designated leader being correct (for BB), or all parties
having the same input value (for BA). We provide a full characterization of the
feasibility and impossibility of good-case latency, for both BA and BB, in the
synchronous sleepy model. Surprisingly to us, we find irrational resilience
thresholds emerging: 2-round good-case BB is possible if and only if at all
times, at least $\frac{1}{\varphi} \approx 0.618$ fraction of the active
parties are correct, where $\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618$ is
the golden ratio; 1-round good-case BA is possible if and only if at least
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707$ fraction of the active parties are correct.

### [28] [Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Configuration Allocation in Pre-Production Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05147)
*Yu Zhu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for adaptive configuration allocation in software testing, integrating Q-learning with a hybrid reward design and offering better performance than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern software systems require extensive testing on diverse configurations that evolve over time, but exhaustively evaluating all possibilities is impractical. Existing combinatorial optimization methods fail in such dynamic, non-stationary environments.

Method: The method introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that models configuration allocation as a sequential decision-making problem, using Q-learning with a hybrid reward system combining simulated outcomes and real-time feedback

Result: The approach outperforms static and optimization-based methods in simulations, with performance nearing that of an ideal oracle with full knowledge

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning provides a powerful new approach to dynamic configuration allocation in software testing, eclipsing traditional techniques and enabling robust, sample-efficient solutions in evolving environments

Abstract: Ensuring reliability in modern software systems requires rigorous
pre-production testing across highly heterogeneous and evolving environments.
Because exhaustive evaluation is infeasible, practitioners must decide how to
allocate limited testing resources across configurations where failure
probabilities may drift over time. Existing combinatorial optimization
approaches are static, ad hoc, and poorly suited to such non-stationary
settings. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that
recasts configuration allocation as a sequential decision-making problem. Our
method is the first to integrate Q-learning with a hybrid reward design that
fuses simulated outcomes and real-time feedback, enabling both sample
efficiency and robustness. In addition, we develop an adaptive online-offline
training scheme that allows the agent to quickly track abrupt probability
shifts while maintaining long-run stability. Extensive simulation studies
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms static and
optimization-based baselines, approaching oracle performance. This work
establishes RL as a powerful new paradigm for adaptive configuration
allocation, advancing beyond traditional methods and offering broad
applicability to dynamic testing and resource scheduling domains.

### [29] [VeriGuard: Enhancing LLM Agent Safety via Verified Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05156)
*Lesly Miculicich,Mihir Parmar,Hamid Palangi,Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham,Mirko Montanari,Tomas Pfister,Long T. Le*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VeriGuard ensures LLM agent safety in healthcare via offline policy verification and online action monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous AI agents in critical domains face risks like deviation from objectives, policy violations, and adversarial attacks. Existing systems lack formal guarantees for safety compliance.

Method: A dual-stage framework: (1) Offline stage synthesizes and formally verifies a safety policy through iterative refinement and (2) Online stage monitors each agent action against the verified policy at runtime.

Result: The framework provides verifiably correct policies through offline validation and ensures real-time adherence via lightweight online monitoring, enabling practical formal safety guarantees.

Conclusion: VeriGuard enhances the trustworthiness of LLM agents in sensitive domains by combining offline policy verification with online runtime monitoring, offering formal safety guarantees.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous AI agents in sensitive domains, such as
healthcare, introduces critical risks to safety, security, and privacy. These
agents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be
compromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates a
mechanism to formally guarantee that an agent's actions adhere to predefined
safety constraints, a challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We
introduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees
for LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and
verifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive
validation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise
safety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and
subjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance
with these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it
is deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action
monitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each
proposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This
separation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online
monitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a
robust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents.

### [30] [Test Case Generation from Bug Reports via Large Language Models: A Cognitive Layered Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05365)
*Irtaza Sajid Qureshi,Zhen Ming,Jiang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Evaluated LLM test generation across Bloom's cognitive layers: models perform well in pattern reproduction but fail under code mutations. Structured technical elements improve success rates by 3×, establishing a benchmark framework for evaluating LLM testing effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty about LLM generalization capabilities in automated testing and their ability to reason about natural language bug reports necessitates systematic evaluation of these cognitive abilities.

Method: Systematic evaluation using Bloom's taxonomy cognitive layers (Remember/Understand/Apply/Analyze/Evaluate/Create) on StarCoder and GPT-4o via LIBRO framework with Defects4J/GHRB datasets and linguistic/semantic mutations.

Result: LLMs show strong pattern reproduction (60%+ accuracy) but fail under identifier mutations (>60% performance drop). Structured code elements (test code/method names) are 3× more impactful than narrative text in test generation success rates.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into LLM cognitive processes in test generation, identifies performance bottlenecks (identifier mutations), and establishes a systematic evaluation framework for LLMs in automated testing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to automated software
testing, yet their ability to generalize beyond memorized patterns and reason
about natural language bug reports remains unclear. We present a systematic
evaluation of LLM reasoning in test case generation, structured around the
cognitive layers of Bloom's taxonomy: \textit{Remember}, \textit{Understand},
\textit{Apply}, \textit{Analyze}, \textit{Evaluate}, and \textit{Create}, which
progressively assess higher levels of cognitive and reasoning capabilities.
Building on the LIBRO framework, we evaluate StarCoder and GPT-4o on Defects4J,
GHRB, and mutated variants that introduce linguistic and semantic challenges.
Our findings show that both models largely reproduce prior results with minor
deviations (\textit{Remember}), exhibit partial robustness to linguistic
rephrasings and translations while uncovering unique reproducible bugs
(\textit{Understand}), but suffer severe performance drops exceeding 60\% under
identifier mutations (\textit{Apply}). Conversely, providing near-identical
few-shot examples in an open-book setting improves success rates by up to three
times, and component-level analysis reveals that structured technical elements,
such as test code and method names, are far more impactful than narrative
descriptions for successful test generation (\textit{Analyze}). These insights
illuminate the cognitive processes underlying LLM-generated tests, suggest
concrete directions for improving performance, and establish a robust and
realistic evaluation paradigm for this task.

*Felicity Anderson,Julien Sindt,Neil Chue Hong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study introduces data-driven RSE personas to analyze Research Software Engineering (RSE) development patterns by mining GitHub repositories. It identifies seven contributor types (e.g., Ephemeral to Active Contributor) across 1,284 open-source RSE projects, demonstrating the method’s feasibility despite project diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RSE collaboration patterns are complex due to varying project management styles, research domains, and contributor backgrounds. This work addresses the need to characterize common RSE behaviors to understand contributions and improve project dynamics.

Method: Combined software repository mining with clustering-based persona creation, analyzing 115,174 contributors across 1,284 GitHub repositories (filtered from 42,284 Zenodo candidates). Focused on mid-sized public RSE projects (10-300 committers) to identify collaborative interaction patterns.

Result: Seven RSE personas were defined based on interactivity levels (e.g., Project Organiser, Low-Coding Closer) and demonstrated that large-scale analysis of diverse RSE projects is possible despite cross-project variability.

Conclusion: The RSE personas framework provides actionable insights into research software collaboration dynamics, enabling teams to evaluate contributions effectively. The method proves scalable for analyzing heterogeneous RSE ecosystems.

Abstract: We describe data-driven RSE personas: an approach combining software
repository mining and data-driven personas applied to research software (RS),
an attempt to describe and identify common and rare patterns of Research
Software Engineering (RSE) development. This allows individuals and RS project
teams to understand their contributions, impact and repository dynamics - an
important foundation for improving RSE. We evaluate the method on different
patterns of collaborative interaction behaviours by contributors to mid-sized
public RS repositories (those with 10-300 committers) on GitHub. We demonstrate
how the RSE personas method successfully characterises a sample of 115,174
repository contributors across 1,284 RS repositories on GitHub, sampled from
42,284 candidate software repository records queried from Zenodo. We identify,
name and summarise seven distinct personas from low to high interactivity:
Ephemeral Contributor; Occasional Contributor; Project Organiser; Moderate
Contributor; Low-Process Closer; Low-Coding Closer; and Active Contributor.
This demonstrates that large datasets can be analysed despite difficulties of
comparing software projects with different project management factors, research
domains and contributor backgrounds.

### [33] [What Types of Code Review Comments Do Developers Most Frequently Resolve?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05450)
*Saul Goldman,Hong Yi Lin,Jirat Pasuksmit,Patanamon Thongtanunam,Kla Tantithamthavorn,Zhe Wang,Ray Zhang,Ali Behnaz,Fan Jiang,Michael Siers,Ryan Jiang,Mike Buller,Minwoo Jeong,Ming Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates how LLM-generated code review comments compare to human-written ones, finding that certain types (e.g., readability, bugs) are more actionable and resolvable by developers than others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatically generated code review comments are not uniformly impactful; understanding which are actionable is critical to improving LLM-powered tools and developer workflows.

Method: Developed an LLM-as-a-Judge to classify review comments using a 5-category taxonomy, followed by an empirical study analyzing comment types and resolution rates across projects.

Result: LLM and human reviewers show context-dependent strengths/weaknesses; readability, bug, and maintainability-focused comments had higher resolution rates than code design-focused ones. A significant portion of LLM-generated comments are resolved by developers.

Conclusion: The study highlights the complementarity between LLM and human reviewers, showing that LLM-generated comments can be actionable and offers suggestions to enhance the effectiveness of automation tools.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered code review automation tools have been
introduced to generate code review comments. However, not all generated
comments will drive code changes. Understanding what types of generated review
comments are likely to trigger code changes is crucial for identifying those
that are actionable. In this paper, we set out to investigate (1) the types of
review comments written by humans and LLMs, and (2) the types of generated
comments that are most frequently resolved by developers. To do so, we
developed an LLM-as-a-Judge to automatically classify review comments based on
our own taxonomy of five categories. Our empirical study confirms that (1) the
LLM reviewer and human reviewers exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses
depending on the project context, and (2) readability, bugs, and
maintainability-related comments had higher resolution rates than those focused
on code design. These results suggest that a substantial proportion of
LLM-generated comments are actionable and can be resolved by developers. Our
work highlights the complementarity between LLM and human reviewers and offers
suggestions to improve the practical effectiveness of LLM-powered code review
tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GitHub recommends SECURITY.md files for vulnerability reporting, but their effectiveness and operational challenges are underexplored. This study addresses these gaps to inform better security practices.

Method: The researchers classified and analyzed 711 issues related to SECURITY.md files and conducted a quantitative comparison of close times and responses across six community health files.

Result: 79.5% of SECURITY.md-related issues were file addition requests, and reports with links were closed 2 days faster. Quantitative analysis provided actionable insights for improving reporting efficiency.

Conclusion: The study concludes that SECURITY.md files face challenges primarily in the form of requests for their addition. Reports with links are resolved faster, indicating the importance of clear guidelines. These insights can enhance security reporting and community management in open-source ecosystems.

Abstract: GitHub recommends that projects adopt a SECURITY.md file that outlines
vulnerability reporting procedures. However, the effectiveness and operational
challenges of such files are not yet fully understood. This study aims to
clarify the challenges that SECURITY.md files face in the vulnerability
reporting process within open-source communities. Specifically, we classified
and analyzed the content of 711 randomly sampled issues related to SECURITY.md.
We also conducted a quantitative comparative analysis of the close time and
number of responses for issues concerning six community health files, including
SECURITY.md. Our analysis revealed that 79.5% of SECURITY.md-related issues
were requests to add the file, and reports that included links were closed,
with a median time that was 2 days shorter. These findings offer practical
insights for improving security reporting policies and community management,
ultimately contributing to a more secure open-source ecosystem.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes leveraging digital twins (DTs)
in software engineering to address skilled engineer shortages,
enabling experts to optimize processes and support domain
specialists in delivering high-quality software. It outlines
benefits, potential DT characteristics, and current gaps in
implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software engineering involves complex, collaborative
processes with domain experts, but lacks resources
(due to skilled engineer shortages). DTs could provide
runtime insights, improve process understanding, and
maximize expert efficiency while supporting non-experts
in software creation.

Method: The authors present a visionary framework for
software engineering DTs by analyzing existing DT
concepts, discussing their application to software
processes, and identifying technical and practical
challenges in deployment. The approach combines
literature review with conceptual design.

Result: Identifies potential benefits: 1. Better time utilization
for software experts 2. Enhanced software quality through
expert-in-the-loop optimization 3. Framework for DT
components (representation, runtime interaction). Highlights
missing requirements: standardized modeling practices,
data integration methods, and validation metrics specific
to software engineering contexts.

Conclusion: DTs offer transformative potential for software
engineering by bridging technical and domain knowledge
gaps. However, realizing this vision requires addressing
key challenges in tooling, collaboration, and outcome
measurement. The paper establishes a foundation for
future research in this emerging field.

Abstract: Digital twins promise a better understanding and use of complex systems. To
this end, they represent these systems at their runtime and may interact with
them to control their processes. Software engineering is a wicked challenge in
which stakeholders from many domains collaborate to produce software artifacts
together. In the presence of skilled software engineer shortage, our vision is
to leverage DTs as means for better rep- resenting, understanding, and
optimizing software engineering processes to (i) enable software experts making
the best use of their time and (ii) support domain experts in producing
high-quality software. This paper outlines why this would be beneficial, what
such a digital twin could look like, and what is missing for realizing and
deploying software engineering digital twins.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Mellum models, a family of open-weight code completion models for JetBrains IDEs, highlighting improvements in quality through data curation and staged training, and the feasibility of a compact, task-focused model for interactive use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to provide high-quality, efficient code completion in IDEs that are open for use and improvement by the community, addressing constraints such as cost and latency in large-scale deployments.

Method: Mellum models utilize a Llama-style architecture with 4B parameters, trained on a curated dataset of ~4T tokens. The method involved an end-to-end industrial pipeline with disciplined data governance, multi-stage training techniques including fill-in-the-middle, project context integration via supervised fine-tuning, and alignment through direct preference optimization using real-world feedback.

Result: Results indicate significant improvements in code completion quality through their pipeline, with successful production deployment in JetBrains IDEs demonstrated by online telemetry data, and multiple model versions released publicly for practical use.

Conclusion: The conclusion presents the Mellum models as a pragmatic solution for moving focused, open models from research to large-scale production, suggesting their approach is a valuable blueprint for similar applications.

Abstract: We present the Mellum models family, open-weight code completion models
designed for interactive use in JetBrains IDEs. Mellums have 4B parameters,
adopt a Llama-style architecture, and are pre-trained on ~4T tokens of
permissively licensed, multi-language code. Our studies show that (i) careful
data curation and staged training significantly improve the model's quality,
(ii) editor-critical capabilities such as context packing are necessary for
high-quality suggestions, and (iii) a compact, task-focused model can meet the
cost and latency constraints of interactive completion.
  In the paper, we describe an end-to-end industrial pipeline for producing
contextualized in-editor completion: disciplined data governance, multi-stage
training that includes fill-in-the-middle and project context via supervised
fine-tuning, and alignment via direct preference optimization using feedback
from real-world scenarios. Our quality evaluations include both large-scale
offline benchmarks and online telemetry from production deployments in
JetBrains IDEs. Mellums are released under the Apache-2.0 license on
HuggingFace, with a public model card providing a reproducible reference for
practitioners. Our experience offers a pragmatic blueprint for taking a
focused, open model from a research prototype to at scale production for
hundreds of thousands of users.

### [38] [A Wave of Resignations in the Aftermath of Remote Onboarding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05878)
*Darja Smite,Franz Zieris,Lars-Ola Damm*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines how work modality impacts employee retention at Ericsson, finding that remote onboarding significantly increases attrition. Successful retention requires in-office presence for new hires and senior mentorship in hybrid models to rebuild organizational attachment after pandemic disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote work normalization during the pandemic has created challenges for employee retention in software teams. This paper investigates how work modality (onsite/remote/hybrid) affects retention, addressing gaps in understanding post-pandemic workforce stability and providing actionable strategies for HR policies.

Method: The research analyzed HR data from Ericsson Sweden (2016-2025), comparing resignation patterns across onsite, remote, and hybrid work modalities. Exit surveys were used to identify factors like organizational attachment and belonging. Longitudinal analysis tracked retention changes pre, during, and post-pandemic.

Result: Resignations increased sharply from 2021-2023, particularly among employees with <5 years tenure and those onboarded remotely. Remote-onboarding employees resigning within three years even after returning to offices were identified. Exit surveys linked attrition to weakened organizational attachment. The company's return-to-office policies successfully restored pre-pandemic retention rates.

Conclusion: The study concludes that hybrid work policies should require in-office presence for new hires and their team members/senior staff to foster organizational attachment and retention through mentorship and social interactions. This approach supports sustainable retention in knowledge-intensive companies post-pandemic.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has permanently altered workplace structures,
normalizing remote work. However, critical evidence highlights challenges with
fully remote arrangements, particularly for software teams. This study
investigates employee resignation patterns at Ericsson, a global developer of
software-intensive systems, before, during, and after the pandemic. Using HR
data from 2016-2025 in Ericsson Sweden, we analyze how different work
modalities (onsite, remote, and hybrid) influence employee retention. Our
findings show a marked increase in resignations from summer 2021 to summer
2023, especially among employees with less than five years of tenure. Employees
onboarded remotely during the pandemic were significantly more likely to resign
within their first three years, even after returning to the office. Exit
surveys suggest that remote onboarding may fail to establish the necessary
organizational attachment, the feeling of belonging and long-term retention. By
contrast, the company's eventual successful return to pre-pandemic retention
rates illustrates the value of differentiated work policies and supports
reconsidering selective return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Our study demonstrates
the importance of employee integration practices in hybrid environments where
the requirement for in-office presence for recent hires shall be accompanied by
in-office presence from their team members and more senior staff whose
mentoring and social interactions contribute to integration into the corporate
work environment. We hope these actionable insights will inform HR leaders and
policymakers in shaping post-pandemic work practices, demonstrating that
carefully crafted hybrid models anchored in organizational attachment and
mentorship can sustain retention in knowledge-intensive companies.

*Scott Frees*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces scalable design patterns for LLM-powered reporting systems, addressing context window limitations through a dual-response architecture and resource management strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Context window constraints in LLMs hinder deployment in reporting systems requiring complete datasets, while prior work lacks documented patterns for scalable implementation despite ResourceLink specifications.

Method: We propose a dual-response pattern extending ResourceLink for iterative query refinement and out-of-band data access, alongside patterns for multi-tenant security and resource lifecycle management.

Result: The patterns provide practical solutions for separating query generation from data retrieval, enabling scalable LLM reporting architectures with documented implementation guidance.

Conclusion: These patterns resolve core challenges in LLM-driven reporting systems by decoupling processing components and establishing standardized resource management approaches.

Abstract: Large language models translate natural language into database queries, yet
context window limitations prevent direct deployment in reporting systems where
complete datasets exhaust available tokens. The Model Context Protocol
specification defines ResourceLink for referencing external resources, but
practical patterns for implementing scalable reporting architectures remain
undocumented. This paper presents patterns for building LLM-powered reporting
systems that decouple query generation from data retrieval. We introduce a
dual-response pattern extending ResourceLink to support both iterative query
refinement and out-of-band data access, accompanied by patterns for
multi-tenant security and resource lifecycle management. These patterns address
fundamental challenges in LLM-driven reporting applications and provide
practical guidance for developers building them.

TL;DR: This study systematically analyzes how software engineers integrate GenAI tools into their workflows, revealing patterns in prompting strategies, task-specific reliability challenges, and proficiency correlations with nuanced AI applications like debugging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to GenAI in software development necessitates understanding holistic workflow integration, as prior research overfocuses on isolated prompt engineering techniques while neglecting broader developer practices.

Method: A large-scale survey of 91 software engineers (72 active GenAI users) across prompting strategies, conversation patterns, and reliability assessments for 14 software engineering tasks.

Result: Key findings: Code generation is pervasive, yet proficiency enables advanced uses like debugging/code review; multi-turn conversations preferred over single-shot prompts; documentation shows highest reliability while complex tasks (debugging, code generation challenges remain significant).

Conclusion: The study establishes an empirical baseline for GenAI integration in software development workflows, identifying critical areas for tool improvement including iterative interaction support and reliability for complex technical tasks.

Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has
fundamentally transformed software development. Although prompt engineering has
emerged as a critical skill, existing research focuses primarily on individual
techniques rather than software developers' broader workflows. This study
presents a systematic investigation of how software engineers integrate GenAI
tools into their professional practice through a large-scale survey examining
prompting strategies, conversation patterns, and reliability assessments across
various software engineering tasks.
  We surveyed 91 software engineers, including 72 active GenAI users, to
understand AI usage patterns throughout the development process. Our 14 key
findings show that while code generation is nearly universal, proficiency
strongly correlates with using AI for more nuanced tasks such as debugging and
code review, and that developers prefer iterative multi-turn conversations to
single-shot prompting. Documentation tasks are perceived as most reliable,
while complex code generation and debugging present sizable challenges. Our
insights provide an empirical baseline of current developer practices, from
simple code generation to deeper workflow integration, with actionable insights
for future improvements.

Motivation: OSS contributors, particularly novices, struggle to interpret fault-prone metrics (e.g., complexity, coupling) in object-oriented systems. Current tools provide numerical signals but lack actionable guidance, creating a barrier to effective code modification. LLMs may address this gap by providing explainable insights.

Method: Proposes an LLM-based assistant framework to generate three explanation types (descriptive, contextual, actionable) and outlines a task-based study with OSS contributors. The study will compare LLM-generated explanations against metric-only baselines, measuring decision quality, time-to-completion, and error rates.

Result: Empirical results pending from planned task-based study.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential to enhance OSS contribution workflows by transforming abstract static analysis metrics into actionable guidance. The next step is validating this hypothesis through controlled evaluation with real contributors.

Abstract: Open Source Software (OSS) has become a very important and crucial
infrastructure worldwide because of the value it provides. OSS typically
depends on contributions from developers across diverse backgrounds and levels
of experience. Making safe changes, such as fixing a bug or implementing a new
feature, can be challenging, especially in object-oriented systems where
components are interdependent. Static analysis and defect-prediction tools
produce metrics (e.g., complexity,coupling) that flag potentially fault-prone
components, but these signals are often hard for contributors new or unfamiliar
with the codebase to interpret. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance on software engineering tasks such as code summarization and
documentation generation. Building on this progress, we investigate whether
LLMs can translate fault-prediction metrics into clear, human-readable risk
explanations and actionable guidance to help OSS contributors plan and review
code modifications. We outline explanation types that an LLM-generated
assistant could provide (descriptive, contextual, and actionable explanations).
We also outline our next steps to assess usefulness through a task-based study
with OSS contributors, comparing metric-only baselines to LLM-generated
explanations on decision quality, time-to-completion, and error rates

Motivation: Many CS1 submissions are uncompilable, limiting student modeling and knowledge tracing. Discarding these submissions loses valuable learning data.

Method: Assessed three LLMs under high/low-context prompting for their ability to compile code while preserving student logic and structure.

Result: All LLMs produced compilable repairs, but varied in preserving students' control flow and structure, affecting pedagogical utility.

Conclusion: Automated repair with LLMs enables richer analysis of coding development by recovering uncompilable submissions while emphasizing structural preservation.

Abstract: A significant portion of student programming submissions in CS1 learning
environments are uncompilable, limiting their use in student modeling and
downstream knowledge tracing. Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude
these cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study
investigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable
code while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling.
Within this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents,
including GPT-5 (OpenAI), Claude 3.5 Haiku (Anthropic), and Gemini 2.5 Flash
(Google), under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were
evaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students'
original structure and logic. We find that while all three LLMs are capable of
producing compilable repairs, their behavior diverges in how well they preserve
students' control flow and code structure, which affects their pedagogical
utility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and
more comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over
time.
