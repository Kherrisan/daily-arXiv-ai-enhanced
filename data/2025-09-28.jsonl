In this paper, we\nfirst reveal that the failure of existing defenses lies in the employment of\nempirical statistical measures that are loosely coupled with backdoor attacks.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Malignity-Aware backdooR defenSe (MARS) that\nleverages backdoor energy (BE) to indicate the malicious extent of each neuron.\nTo amplify malignity, we further extract the most prominent BE values from each\nmodel to form a concentrated backdoor energy (CBE).

Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a\npair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed\nSS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic\ntransmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create\nthe adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the\nsemantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial\nattack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the\nsystem security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware\ninfrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while\npreventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by\nminimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial\nattack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk. Simulation\nresults validate the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ISAC framework in terms\nof both SAC and eavesdropping prevention performance."}

Machine\nlearning (ML)-based traffic detection technology, capable of identifying\nanomalous patterns and potential threats within this traffic, serves as a\ncritical component in ensuring network security. This study first identifies a\nsignificant issue with widely adopted feature extraction tools (e.g.,\nCICMeterFlow): the extensive use of time- and length-related features leads to\nhigh sparsity, which adversely affects model convergence. Furthermore, existing\ntraffic detection methods generally lack an embedding mechanism capable of\nefficiently and comprehensively capturing the semantic characteristics of\nnetwork traffic. To address these challenges, we propose a novel feature\nextraction tool that eliminates traditional time and length features in favor\nof context-aware semantic features related to the source host, thus improving\nthe generalizability of the model. In addition, we design an embedding training\nframework that integrates the unsupervised DBSCAN clustering algorithm with a\ncontrastive learning strategy to effectively capture fine-grained semantic\nrepresentations of traffic. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted on\nthe real-world Mawi data set to validate the proposed method in terms of\ndetection accuracy, robustness, and generalization.
