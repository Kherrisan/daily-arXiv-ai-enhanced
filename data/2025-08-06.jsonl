This\nlimitation stems from current architectures that conflate probabilistic,\nhigh-level planning with low-level action execution within a single generative\nprocess. To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new\nparadigm built on the \"Blueprint First, Model Second\" philosophy. Our framework\ndecouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined\noperational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution\nBlueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is\nstrategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex\nsub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark,\ndesigned for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the\nSource Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the\nstrongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while\ndramatically improving execution efficiency.

We first categorize backdoor triggers from a new\nperspective, i.e., their impact on the patched area, and divide them into:\nhigh-visibility triggers (HVT), semi-visibility triggers (SVT), and\nlow-visibility triggers (LVT). Based on this classification, we propose a\nprogressive defense framework, BDFirewall, that removes these triggers from the\nmost conspicuous to the most subtle, without requiring model access. First, for\nHVTs, which create the most significant local semantic distortions, we identify\nand eliminate them by detecting these salient differences. We then restore the\npatched area to mitigate the adverse impact of such removal process. The\nlocalized purification designed for HVTs is, however, ineffective against SVTs,\nwhich globally perturb benign features. We therefore model an SVT-poisoned\ninput as a mixture of a trigger and benign features, where we unconventionally\ntreat the benign features as \"noise\". This formulation allows us to reconstruct\nSVTs by applying a denoising process that removes these benign \"noise\"\nfeatures. The SVT-free input is then obtained by subtracting the reconstructed\ntrigger. Finally, to neutralize the nearly imperceptible but fragile LVTs, we\nintroduce lightweight noise to disrupt the trigger pattern and then apply DDPM\nto restore any collateral impact on clean features. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art defenses. Compared\nwith baselines, BDFirewall reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average\nof 33.25%, improving poisoned sample accuracy (PA) by 29.64%, and achieving up\nto a 111x speedup in inference time.

While recent Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in\ndesign-to-code tasks, they often fail to accurately preserve the layout during\ncode generation. To this end, we draw inspiration from the Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) reasoning in human cognition and propose LaTCoder, a novel approach that\nenhances layout preservation in webpage design during code generation with\nLayout-as-Thought (LaT). Specifically, we first introduce a simple yet\nefficient algorithm to divide the webpage design into image blocks. Next, we\nprompt MLLMs using a CoTbased approach to generate code for each block.\nFinally, we apply two assembly strategies-absolute positioning and an\nMLLM-based method-followed by dynamic selection to determine the optimal\noutput. We evaluate the effectiveness of LaTCoder using multiple backbone MLLMs\n(i.e., DeepSeek-VL2, Gemini, and GPT-4o) on both a public benchmark and a newly\nintroduced, more challenging benchmark (CC-HARD) that features complex layouts.\nThe experimental results on automatic metrics demonstrate significant\nimprovements. Specifically, TreeBLEU scores increased by 66.67% and MAE\ndecreased by 38% when using DeepSeek-VL2, compared to direct prompting.\nMoreover, the human preference evaluation results indicate that annotators\nfavor the webpages generated by LaTCoder in over 60% of cases, providing strong\nevidence of the effectiveness of our method."}

As the prevalence and\nsophistication of these attacks increase, machine learning and deep neural\nnetwork approaches have emerged as effective tools for enhancing NIDS\ncapabilities in detecting malicious activities. However, the effectiveness of\ntraditional deep neural models is often limited by the need for extensive\nlabelled datasets and the challenges posed by data and feature heterogeneity\nacross different network domains. To address these limitations, we developed a\ndeep neural model that integrates multi-modal learning with domain adaptation\ntechniques for classification. Our model processes data from diverse sources in\na sequential cyclic manner, allowing it to learn from multiple datasets and\nadapt to varying feature spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed model significantly outperforms baseline neural models in classifying\nnetwork intrusions, particularly under conditions of varying sample\navailability and probability distributions. The model's performance highlights\nits ability to generalize across heterogeneous datasets, making it an efficient\nsolution for real-world network intrusion detection."}

ReFuzzer employs a feedback loop with a local\nLLM to validate and filter erroneous programs before execution, improving\nfuzzing effectiveness beyond crash detection and enabling the generation of\ndiverse yet valid test programs.\n  We evaluated ReFuzzer's effectiveness across black-, grey- and white-box\nfuzzing approaches targeting LLVM/Clang. ReFuzzer improved test programs'\nvalidity from 47.0-49.4% to 96.6-97.3%, with an average processing time of\n2.9-3.5 s per test program on a dual-GPU machine. Further, refuzzing\nsignificantly increased code coverage in critical optimization and IR\ngeneration components.
