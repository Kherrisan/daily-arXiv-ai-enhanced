The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of\nIoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both\nprivacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL)\noffers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without\nexposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx\noften fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and\nnon-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint\nmalware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E\n(Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports\nindirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy.\nEach client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact\nsummaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to\nclients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based\naugmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than\nrelying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables\nclients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns\nobserved across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients.\nThis targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity\nwith minimal communication overhead.

A Large-Scale Controlled Experiment on Warning Dialogue Explanations", "comment": null, "summary": "Phishing has become a prominent risk in modern cybersecurity, often used to\nbypass technological defences by exploiting predictable human behaviour.\nWarning dialogues are a standard mitigation measure, but the lack of\nexplanatory clarity and static content limits their effectiveness. In this\npaper, we report on our research to assess the capacity of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to generate clear, concise, and scalable explanations for\nphishing warnings. We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N\n= 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually\ngenerated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nand Llama 3.3 70B. We investigated two explanatory styles (feature-based and\ncounterfactual) for their effects on behavioural metrics (click-through rate)\nand perceptual outcomes (e.g., trust, risk, clarity). The results indicate that\nwell-constructed LLM-generated explanations can equal or surpass manually\ncrafted explanations in reducing susceptibility to phishing; Claude-generated\nwarnings exhibited particularly robust performance. Feature-based explanations\nwere more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual\nexplanations diminished false-positive rates. Other variables such as workload,\ngender, and prior familiarity with warning dialogues significantly moderated\nwarning effectiveness. These results indicate that LLMs can be used to\nautomatically build explanations for warning users against phishing, and that\nsuch solutions are scalable, adaptive, and consistent with human-centred\nvalues."}

Such hardware\nprotects credentials from extraction by an adversary who has compromised the\nmain operating system, such as a malicious third-party app. Since 2011, Android\napp developers can access trusted hardware via the Android Keystore API. In\nthis work, we conduct the first comprehensive survey of hardware-backed key\nstorage in Android devices. We analyze 490 119 Android apps, collecting data on\nhow trusted hardware is used by app developers (if used at all) and\ncross-referencing our findings with sensitive user data collected by each app,\nas self-reported by developers via the Play Store's data safety labels.\n  We find that despite industry-wide initiatives to encourage adoption, 56.3%\nof apps self-reporting as processing sensitive user data do not use Android's\ntrusted hardware capabilities at all, while just 5.03% of apps collecting some\nform of sensitive data use the strongest form of trusted hardware, a secure\nelement distinct from the main processor. To better understand the potential\ndownsides of using secure hardware, we conduct the first empirical analysis of\ntrusted hardware performance in mobile devices, measuring the runtime of common\ncryptographic operations across both software- and hardware-backed keystores.\nWe find that while hardware-backed key storage using a coprocessor is viable\nfor most common cryptographic operations, secure elements capable of preventing\nmore advanced attacks make performance infeasible for symmetric encryption with\nnon-negligible payloads and any kind of asymmetric encryption."}

Data is encrypted not only during rest\nand transit, but also during processing. However, FHE provides a limited\ninstruction set: SIMD addition, SIMD multiplication, and cyclic rotation of 1-D\nvectors. This restriction makes performing multi-dimensional tensor operations\nchallenging. Practitioners must pack these tensors into 1-D vectors and map\ntensor operations onto this one-dimensional layout rather than their\ntraditional nested structure. And while prior systems have made significant\nstrides in automating this process, they often hide critical packing decisions\nbehind layers of abstraction, making debugging, optimizing, and building on top\nof these systems difficult.\n  In this work, we approach multi-dimensional tensor operations in FHE through\nEinstein summation (einsum) notation. Einsum notation explicitly encodes\ndimensional structure and operations in its syntax, naturally exposing how\ntensors should be packed and transformed. We decompose einsum expressions into\na fixed set of FHE-friendly operations. We implement our design and present\nEinHops, a minimalist system that factors einsum expressions into a fixed\nsequence of FHE operations. EinHops enables developers to perform encrypted\ntensor operations using FHE while maintaining full visibility into the\nunderlying packing strategy. We evaluate EinHops on a range of tensor\noperations from a simple transpose to complex multi-dimensional contractions.\nWe show that the explicit nature of einsum notation allows us to build an FHE\ntensor system that is simple, general, and interpretable. We open-source\nEinHops at the following repository: https://github.com/baahl-nyu/einhops."}

By injecting instructions into the data accessed by the\nsystem, the attacker is able to override the initial user task with an\narbitrary task directed by the attacker. To secure the system, test-time\ndefenses, e.g., defensive prompting, have been proposed for system developers\nto attain security only when needed in a flexible manner. However, they are\nmuch less effective than training-time defenses that change the model\nparameters. Motivated by this, we propose DefensiveToken, a test-time defense\nwith prompt injection robustness comparable to training-time alternatives.\nDefensiveTokens are newly inserted as special tokens, whose embeddings are\noptimized for security. In security-sensitive cases, system developers can\nappend a few DefensiveTokens before the LLM input to achieve security with a\nminimal utility drop. In scenarios where security is less of a concern,\ndevelopers can simply skip DefensiveTokens; the LLM system remains the same as\nthere is no defense, generating high-quality responses. Thus, DefensiveTokens,\nif released alongside the model, allow a flexible switch between the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) utility and almost-SOTA security at test time.
