### [1] [Automating the RMF: Lessons from the FedRAMP 20x Pilot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09613)
*Isaac Henry Teuscher*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FedRAMP 20x modernizes cloud security authorization by replacing traditional NIST 800-53 controls with Key Security Indicators (KSIs), automating evidence collection, and enabling continuous reporting. The case study analyzes its impact on streamlining DevSecOps and risk management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FedRAMP's static, manual risk assessment methods were ill-suited for cloud-native development, necessitating a shift to dynamic, automated compliance frameworks aligned with modern deployment practices.

Method: Practitioner-led field study analyzing multiple FedRAMP 20x pilot submissions through stakeholder collaboration with FedRAMP PMO, 3PAOs, and working groups. Focuses on KSI implementation and DevSecOps integration.

Result: FedRAMP 20x acts as a testbed for automation-first RMF adoption. Results show improved authorization efficiency, real-time risk visibility, and actionable insights for modernizing compliance through continuous monitoring and machine-readable evidence pipelines.

Conclusion: The study validates cloud-native security frameworks as viable for regulatory compliance, with KSIs and DevSecOps integration enabling real-time risk decisions. Recommends wider adoption of automation-centric RMF adaptations for evolving digital infrastructures.

Abstract: The U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) has long
relied on extensive sets of controls and static documentation to assess cloud
systems. However, this manual, point-in-time approach has struggled to keep
pace with cloud-native development. FedRAMP 20x, a 2025 pilot program,
reimagines the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF): replacing traditional NIST
800-53 controls with Key Security Indicators (KSIs), using automated,
machine-readable evidence, and emphasizing continuous reporting and
authorization.
  This case study presents a practitioner-led field report from an industry
participant who led multiple FedRAMP 20x pilot submissions and engaged directly
with the FedRAMP PMO, 3PAOs, and community working groups. It explores how
KSIs, continuous evidence pipelines, and DevSecOps integration can streamline
authorization and improve cyber risk management. The study shows FedRAMP 20x as
a live testbed for implementing the RMF in a cloud-native, automation-first
approach and shares actionable recommendations for risk professionals seeking
to modernize compliance and support real-time, risk-informed decision-making.

### [2] [A Biosecurity Agent for Lifecycle LLM Biosecurity Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09615)
*Meiyin Meng,Zaixi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Biosecurity Agent with four coordinated modes (dataset sanitization, preference alignment, run-time guardrails, and automated red teaming) to mitigate dual-use risks of large language models in biomedical research while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expanded use of LLMs in biomedical workflows raises biosecurity concerns (e.g., toxic compound synthesis). Current security measures are insufficient to address lifecycle risks.

Method: 1) Dataset sanitization (3 tiers of text filtering on CORD-19 dataset); 2) DPO preference alignment with LoRA adapters for refusal training; 3) Multi-tier run-time guardrails balancing security/usability; 4) Continuous automated red-teaming against malicious prompts.

Result: Mode 1 shows 0.46-70.40% content removal across tiers; Mode 2 reduces attack success rate from 59.7% to 3.0%; Mode 3 achieves L2 balance (F1=0.720, precision=0.900) vs L3's stricter filtering; Mode 4 shows 0 successful jailbreaks in testing.

Conclusion: The Biosecurity Agent provides auditable, lifecycle-aligned framework that reduces dual-use risks without significant utility loss, establishing a precedent for LLM security in scientific research with quantifiable trade-off balances.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into biomedical
research workflows--from literature triage and hypothesis generation to
experimental design--yet this expanded utility also heightens dual-use
concerns, including the potential misuse for guiding toxic compound synthesis.
In response, this study shows a Biosecurity Agent that comprises four
coordinated modes across the model lifecycle: dataset sanitization, preference
alignment, run-time guardrails, and automated red teaming. For dataset
sanitization (Mode 1), evaluation is conducted on CORD-19, a COVID-19 Open
Research Dataset of coronavirus-related scholarly articles. We define three
sanitization tiers--L1 (compact, high-precision), L2 (human-curated biosafety
terms), and L3 (comprehensive union)--with removal rates rising from 0.46% to
70.40%, illustrating the safety-utility trade-off. For preference alignment
(Mode 2), DPO with LoRA adapters internalizes refusals and safe completions,
reducing end-to-end attack success rate (ASR) from 59.7% to 3.0%. At inference
(Mode 3), run-time guardrails across L1-L3 show the expected security-usability
trade-off: L2 achieves the best balance (F1 = 0.720, precision = 0.900, recall
= 0.600, FPR =0.067), while L3 offers stronger jailbreak resistance at the cost
of higher false positives. Under continuous automated red-teaming (Mode 4), no
successful jailbreaks are observed under the tested protocol. Taken together,
our biosecurity agent offers an auditable, lifecycle-aligned framework that
reduces attack success while preserving benign utility, providing safeguards
for the use of LLMs in scientific research and setting a precedent for future
agent-level security protections.

### [3] [Causal Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Security: A Framework for Robust Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09616)
*Mohammadhossein Homaei,Mehran Tarif,Mar Avilla,Andres Caro*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The CDT framework improves security in ICS by combining causal inference and digital twin modeling, leading to accurate anomaly detection and effective defense strategies with real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods in ICS cannot distinguish true causal relationships from spurious ones, causing high false alarms and poor root cause analysis.

Method: Proposed is the Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework that merges causal inference theory with digital twin modeling, enabling association, intervention, and counterfactual analysis.

Result: The CDT achieved high F1-scores across three datasets (SWaT, WADI, HAI) with significant reductions in false positives and improved root cause analysis and attack prevention.

Conclusion: CDT effectively addresses the limitations of current methods in ICS security, offering high accuracy, reduced false alarms, and real-time performance, suitable for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) face growing cyber-physical attacks that
exploit both network vulnerabilities and physical processes. Current anomaly
detection methods rely on correlation-based analysis, which cannot separate
true causal relationships from spurious associations. This limitation results
in high false alarm rates and poor root cause analysis. We propose a novel
Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework for cyber-physical security in medium-scale
ICS. Our method combines causal inference theory with digital twin modeling.
The framework enables three types of causal reasoning: association for pattern
detection, intervention for understanding system responses, and counterfactual
analysis for attack prevention planning. We evaluate our framework on three
industrial datasets: SWaT, WADI, and HAI, with validation through physical
constraint compliance (90.8\%) and synthetic ground truth testing (structural
Hamming distance 0.13). Results show significant improvements over seven
baseline methods. Our CDT achieves F1-scores are $0.944 \pm 0.014$ for SWaT,
$0.902 \pm 0.021$ for WADI, and $0.923 \pm 0.018$ for HAI with statistical
significance ($p < 0.0024$, Bonferroni corrected). The framework reduces false
positives by \SI{74}{\percent} and achieves \SI{78.4}{\percent} root cause
analysis accuracy compared to \SI{48.7}{\percent} for existing methods.
Counterfactual analysis enables defense strategies that reduce attack success
by \SI{73.2}{\percent}. The system keeps real-time performance with
\SI{3.2}{ms} latency, which is suitable for industrial deployment, while
providing interpretable explanations for operators.

*Dmitrii A. Gerasimov*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ChipmunkRing presents a practical post-quantum ring signature construction for blockchains, offering compact signatures and improved signing/verification speeds through its Acorn Verification protocol. It provides 112-bit security and works with anonymity sets and threshold constructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for secure and efficient post-quantum digital signatures in blockchain settings, where traditional cryptographic methods may be vulnerable to future quantum computing threats.

Method: The authors employ the Chipmunk lattice-based cryptographic framework and introduce Acorn Verification, a simplified zero-knowledge protocol that replaces the Fiat-Shamir methodology. This new protocol allows for linear authentication complexity and concise cryptographic proofs per participant. The paper also provides mathematical security proofs, computational benchmarking, and support for standard anonymity sets and threshold constructions.

Result: ChipmunkRing produces digital signatures that range from 20.5 to 279.7 KB for groups of 2-64 participants. The signing process takes 1.1-15.1 ms, and verification requires 0.4-4.5 ms. It achieves a 17.7x performance improvement for 32-member rings compared to conventional techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed ring signature construction demonstrates strong post-quantum security (meeting NIST Level 1 standards), fast signing and verification, and flexibility to support various ring-based configurations with efficient proofs. This makes it a viable solution for securing blockchains against quantum computational threats.

Abstract: ChipmunkRing, a practical post-quantum ring signature construction tailored
for blockchain environments. Building on our Chipmunk lattice-based
cryptographic framework, this implementation delivers compact digital
signatures ranging from 20.5 to 279.7KB, with rapid signing operations
completing in 1.1-15.1ms and efficient validation processes requiring only
0.4-4.5ms for participant groups of 2-64 members. The cornerstone of our
approach is Acorn Verification-a streamlined zero-knowledge protocol that
supersedes the classical Fiat-Shamir methodology. This innovation enables
linear O(n) authentication complexity using concise 96-byte cryptographic
proofs per participant, yielding a remarkable 17.7x performance enhancement for
32-member rings when compared to conventional techniques. Our work includes
rigorous mathematical security demonstrations confirming 112-bit post-quantum
protection (NIST Level 1), extensive computational benchmarking, and
comprehensive support for both standard anonymity sets and collaborative
threshold constructions with flexible participation requirements.

### [6] [Risk-Calibrated Bayesian Streaming Intrusion Detection with SRE-Aligned Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09619)
*Michel Youssef*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a risk-calibrated intrusion detection system using Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection aligned with SRE error budgets, The method optimizes alert decisions based on operational costs and demonstrates improved performance metrics compared to unsupervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for adaptive intrusion detection in dynamic environments, where false positives and false negatives have significant operational costs, and the alignment with SRE error budgets ensures systems stay within service level objectives (SLOs) while maintaining security.

Method: The method couples Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) with decision thresholds derived from Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) error budgets. It uses run-length posteriors adapted to distribution shift and concept drift. The approach includes a hazard model, conjugate updates, and an O(1)-per-event implementation for efficiency.

Result: The system shows improved precision-recall at mid to high recall, better probability calibration (via Brier score and reliability diagrams), and detection latency measured in events over benchmarks like UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017. Risk calibration and alignment with SRE error budgets are validated through experiments.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating BOCPD with SRE-aligned thresholding is a promising approach for intrusion detection in streaming data, offering quantitative SLO compliance while accounting for varying costs of errors and efficient computation.

Abstract: We present a risk-calibrated approach to streaming intrusion detection that
couples Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) with decision thresholds
aligned to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) error budgets. BOCPD provides
run-length posteriors that adapt to distribution shift and concept drift; we
map these posteriors to alert decisions by optimizing expected operational cost
under false-positive and false-negative budgets. We detail the hazard model,
conjugate updates, and an O(1)-per-event implementation. A concrete SRE example
shows how a 99.9% availability SLO (43.2 minutes per month error budget) yields
a probability threshold near 0.91 when missed incidents are 10x more costly
than false alarms. We evaluate on the full UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017 benchmarks
with chronological splits, comparing against strong unsupervised baselines
(ECOD, COPOD, and LOF). Metrics include PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier score,
calibration reliability diagrams, and detection latency measured in events.
Results indicate improved precision-recall at mid to high recall and better
probability calibration relative to baselines. We release implementation
details, hyperparameters, and ablations for hazard sensitivity and
computational footprint. Code and reproducibility materials will be made
available upon publication; datasets and implementation are available from the
corresponding author upon reasonable request.

### [7] [Toward a Unified Security Framework for AI Agents: Trust, Risk, and Liability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09620)
*Jiayun Mo,Xin Kang,Tieyan Li,Zhongding Lei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Trust, Risk and Liability (TRL) framework to systematically address trust issues, risk analysis, and liability attribution in AI agents, particularly for 6G networks, by integrating their interdependent relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for AI trust, risk, and liability issues are fragmented and fail to address their interdependent nature, leading to incomplete risk mitigation and accountability gaps in AI systems.

Method: The TRL framework establishes a holistic methodology linking trust-building, risk-mitigation, and liability-allocation processes, enabling context-specific analysis of AI applications through structured interdependencies between these three dimensions.

Result: The framework demonstrates applicability across AI scenarios, offering societal, economic, and ethical implications while promoting trustworthy AI implementation. It provides a foundation for addressing challenges in 6G networks through systematic risk analysis and liability mapping.

Conclusion: The TRL framework presents a holistic approach to enhance AI trustworthiness and responsibility by systematically addressing the interconnected challenges of trust, risk, and liability, with significant potential for 6G network applications.

Abstract: The excitement brought by the development of AI agents came alongside arising
problems. These concerns centered around users' trust issues towards AIs, the
risks involved, and the difficulty of attributing responsibilities and
liabilities. Current solutions only attempt to target each problem separately
without acknowledging their inter-influential nature. The Trust, Risk and
Liability (TRL) framework proposed in this paper, however, ties together the
interdependent relationships of trust, risk, and liability to provide a
systematic method of building and enhancing trust, analyzing and mitigating
risks, and allocating and attributing liabilities. It can be applied to analyze
any application scenarios of AI agents and suggest appropriate measures fitting
to the context. The implications of the TRL framework lie in its potential
societal impacts, economic impacts, ethical impacts, and more. It is expected
to bring remarkable values to addressing potential challenges and promoting
trustworthy, risk-free, and responsible usage of AI in 6G networks.

### [8] [A Systematic Literature Review on Fundamental Technologies and Security Challenges in the Metaverse Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09621)
*Krishno Dey,Diogo Barradas,Saqib Hakak*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This survey paper examines security and privacy threats in the Metaverse, leveraging a systematic literature review (SLR) to analyze vulnerabilities and countermeasures. It highlights gaps in existing solutions and proposes future research directions for a secure and ethical Metaverse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Metaverse's evolving nature introduces significant security, privacy, and sustainability risks due to its immersive, decentralized, and permanent characteristics. Existing countermeasures are largely theoretical, necessitating a structured review of vulnerabilities and solutions to ensure user safety.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic literature review (SLR), compiling and analyzing key vulnerabilities, their countermeasures, and gaps in real-world testing to assess the Metaverse's security landscape.

Result: Findings reveal that Metaverse platforms have a significantly larger attack surface compared to conventional digital systems. Immersive and decentralized features introduce novel threats, but existing countermeasures remain untested in practical environments.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for robust, real-world-tested security frameworks, ethically governed data practices, and collaborative research to address current gaps. It outlines critical future directions for ensuring a resilient Metaverse.

Abstract: The Metaverse utilizes emerging technologies such as Extended Reality (XR),
Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and digital twins to provide an
immersive and interactive virtual experience. As Metaverse continues to evolve,
it bring a range of security and privacy threats, such as identity management,
data governance, and user interactions. This survey aims to provide a
comprehensive review of the enabling technologies for the Metaverse. It also
aims to provide a thorough analysis of key vulnerabilities and threats that may
compromise its sustainability and user safety. We perform a systematic
literature review (SLR) to identify key vulnerabilities and their
countermeasures in Metaverse platforms. Metaverse offers a much larger attack
surface compared to conventional digital platforms. Immersive, decentralized,
and permanent characteristics of the Metaverse generate new vulnerabilities.
Although there are many countermeasures to these vulnerabilities, most of them
are theoretical or have not been tested in real-world environments. Our review
highlights current advancements, identifies research gaps, and outlines future
directions to ensure a secure, resilient, and ethically governed Metaverse.

### [9] [A Survey of Transaction Tracing Techniques for Blockchain Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09624)
*Ayush Kumar,Vrizlynn L. L. Thing*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study systematically reviews, categorizes, and compares blockchain transaction tracing techniques, highlighting existing limitations and suggesting future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to track assets across different blockchain ledgers, especially to combat criminal activities that use cross-ledger trades to obscure asset flows.

Method: The method involves a systematic review of existing literature on blockchain transaction tracing techniques, categorizing and comparing them based on multiple criteria including tracing approach and targeted objectives.

Result: The result is a categorized compendium of tracing techniques, an analysis of their limitations, and insights into the current state of blockchain transaction tracing literature.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a comprehensive understanding of existing tracing techniques is essential for addressing cross-ledger tracking challenges and suggests future research avenues to overcome identified limitations.

Abstract: With the proliferation of new blockchain-based cryptocurrencies/assets and
platforms that make it possible to transact across them, it becomes important
to consider not just whether the transfer of coins/assets can be tracked within
their respective transaction ledger, but also if they can be tracked as they
move across ledgers. This is especially important given that there are
documented cases of criminals attempting to use these cross-ledger trades to
obscure the flow of their coins/assets. In this paper, we perform a systematic
review of the various tracing techniques for blockchain transactions proposed
in literature, categorize them using multiple criteria (such as tracing
approach and targeted objective) and compare them. Based on the above
categorization, we provide insights on the state of blockchain transaction
tracing literature and identify the limitations of existing approaches.
Finally, we suggest directions for future research in this area based on our
analysis.

### [10] [Smart Medical IoT Security Vulnerabilities: Real-Time MITM Attack Analysis, Lightweight Encryption Implementation, and Practitioner Perceptions in Underdeveloped Nigerian Healthcare Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09629)
*Aminu Muhammad Auwal*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study evaluates lightweight AES-128 encryption for securing medical IoT (mIoT) devices in Nigerian healthcare, demonstrating its effectiveness against MITM attacks while maintaining low costs and minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsecured wireless communication in resource-constrained Nigerian healthcare IoT systems exposes patient data to cyber threats, necessitating cost-effective encryption solutions for clinical adoption.

Method: A prototype mIoT device with NodeMCU ESP8266 was used to simulate real-time MITM attacks via Bettercap/Wireshark. AES-128 encryption was tested for security and performance under lab conditions mimicking local healthcare networks.

Result: AES-128 encrypted data was fully protected from interception and tampering (0% readability for attackers) with 56.25% latency increase and 15-45USD cost. Surveys revealed professional support for encryption paired with training despite budget/complexity barriers.

Conclusion: Lightweight AES-128 encryption is practical for securing Nigerian mIoT systems, but broader deployment requires improved security awareness and clinical implementation guidelines.

Abstract: The growing use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in Nigerian
healthcare offers potential improvements in remote monitoring and data-driven
care, but unsecured wireless communication in medical IoT (mIoT) devices
exposes patient data to cyber threats. This study investigates such
vulnerabilities through a real-time Man in the Middle (MITM) attack simulation
and evaluates lightweight AES-128 encryption on low-cost devices.
  A prototype mIoT device was built with a NodeMCU ESP8266 and sensors for
heart rate and temperature. In controlled lab conditions simulating local
healthcare networks, unencrypted data transmissions were intercepted and
altered using common tools (Bettercap, Wireshark). After AES-128 encryption was
applied, all transmissions became unreadable and tamper attempts failed,
demonstrating its effectiveness.
  Performance costs were modest, latency rose from 80 ms to 125 ms (56.25
percent increase) and CPU use from 30 percent to 45 percent, but system
stability remained intact. Device cost stayed under 18,000 NGN (about 12 USD),
making it feasible for Nigeria's resource constrained facilities.
  A survey of healthcare professionals showed moderate awareness of IoT-related
risks but strong support for encryption and staff training. Barriers included
limited budgets and technical complexity.
  The study concludes that lightweight AES-128 encryption provides practical,
low-cost protection against common attack vectors while maintaining operational
efficiency. Feedback from professionals highlights the urgency of improving
security awareness and establishing guidelines for clinical deployment.

### [11] [Hound: Relation-First Knowledge Graphs for Complex-System Reasoning in Security Audits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09633)
*Bernhard Mueller*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Hound introduces a relation-first graph engine with persistent belief systems for codebase vulnerability analysis, outperforming LLM baselines in recall and F1 on ScaBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional code analysis struggles with system-level reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases, limiting vulnerability detection effectiveness.

Method: Hound employs flexible relation-first graphs for analyst-defined views with compact annotations and a persistent belief system for updating vulnerability hypotheses. It uses coverage-versus-intuition planning, exact retrieval of relevant code, and a QA finalizer.

Result: On ScaBench subset projects, Hound achieves 31.2%/14.2% micro recall/F1 (vs. 8.3%/9.8%) for LLM baselines with modest precision trade-off. Gains attributed to abstract relation graphs and hypothesis loops.

Conclusion: Hound demonstrates improved system reasoning through relational-first approaches and hypothesis-driven belief systems, with artifacts shared for reproducibility.

Abstract: Hound introduces a relation-first graph engine that improves system-level
reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases. The agent
designs flexible, analyst-defined views with compact annotations (e.g.,
monetary/value flows, authentication/authorization roles, call graphs, protocol
invariants) and uses them to anchor exact retrieval: for any question, it loads
precisely the code that matters (often across components) so it can zoom out to
system structure and zoom in to the decisive lines. A second contribution is a
persistent belief system: long-lived vulnerability hypotheses whose confidence
is updated as evidence accrues. The agent employs coverage-versus-intuition
planning and a QA finalizer to confirm or reject hypotheses. On a five-project
subset of ScaBench[1], Hound improves recall and F1 over a baseline LLM
analyzer (micro recall 31.2% vs. 8.3%; F1 14.2% vs. 9.8%) with a modest
precision trade-off. We attribute these gains to flexible, relation-first
graphs that extend model understanding beyond call/dataflow to abstract
aspects, plus the hypothesis-centric loop; code and artifacts are released to
support reproduction.

### [12] [A Method for Quantifying Human Risk and a Blueprint for LLM Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09635)
*Giuseppe Canale*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF), the first end-to-end methodology for quantifying human vulnerabilities in cybersecurity operations by combining psychological constructs with existing security tools, validated in a proof-of-concept deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on human factors in cybersecurity is fragmented, with studies isolating elements such as alert fatigue and cognitive overload without operationalizing them within a unified framework that integrates with real-time operations.

Method: The framework uses three approaches: 1) developing algorithms to measure psychological states using standard SOC tools, 2) creating a RAG-based LLM for structured and unstructured data to detect psychological risks, and 3) validating against synthetic data due to data privacy challenges.

Result: The proof-of-concept LSTM-based model achieved an F1-score of 0.92 on synthetic data, demonstrating the feasibility of the framework.

Conclusion: The CPF offers a strong foundation for practical, privacy-compliant human risk analysis in cybersecurity, enabling real-world empirical studies through industry partnerships.

Abstract: This paper presents the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF), a novel
methodology for quantifying human-centric vulnerabilities in security
operations through systematic integration of established psychological
constructs with operational security telemetry. While individual human
factors-alert fatigue, compliance fatigue, cognitive overload, and risk
perception biases-have been extensively studied in isolation, no framework
provides end-to-end operationalization across the full spectrum of
psychological vulnerabilities. We address this gap by: (1) defining specific,
measurable algorithms that quantify key psychological states using standard SOC
tooling (SIEM, ticketing systems, communication platforms); (2) proposing a
lightweight, privacy-preserving LLM architecture based on Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning to analyze structured and
unstructured data for latent psychological risks; (3) detailing a rigorous
mixed-methods validation strategy acknowledging the inherent difficulty of
obtaining sensitive cybersecurity data. Our implementation of CPF indicators
has been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept deployment using small language
models achieving 0.92 F1-score on synthetic data. This work provides the
theoretical and methodological foundation necessary for industry partnerships
to conduct empirical validation with real operational data.

### [13] [AdaptAuth: Multi-Layered Behavioral and Credential Analysis for a Secure and Adaptive Authentication Framework for Password Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09645)
*Tonmoy Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multifaceted password security framework combining device/network data, human behavior analysis, and adaptive policies to enhance protection while improving user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional password systems face usability issues leading to weak compliance, leaving users vulnerable despite technological advancements.

Method: Integrates Password Dissection Mechanism, Dynamic Password Policy, behavioral patterns, device/network/geographical data with machine learning models to create adaptive user profiles for authentication.

Result: Framework achieves stronger security than existing standards while involving users in policy creation through an adaptive, usability-focused approach.

Conclusion: The proposed solution redefines password security by holistically addressing technical and human factors, offering robust defense against emerging threats through integrated, adaptive mechanisms.

Abstract: Password security has been compelled to evolve in response to the growing
computational capabilities of modern systems. However, this evolution has often
resulted in increasingly complex security practices that alienate users,
leading to poor compliance and heightened vulnerability. Consequently,
individuals remain exposed to attackers through weak or improperly managed
passwords, underscoring the urgent need for a comprehensive defense mechanism
that effectively addresses password-related risks and threats. In this paper,
we propose a multifaceted solution designed to revolutionize password security
by integrating diverse attributes such as the Password Dissection Mechanism,
Dynamic Password Policy Mechanism, human behavioral patterns, device
characteristics, network parameters, geographical context, and other relevant
factors. By leveraging learning-based models, our framework constructs detailed
user profiles capable of recognizing individuals and preventing nearly all
forms of unauthorized access or device possession. The proposed framework
enhances the usability-security paradigm by offering stronger protection than
existing standards while simultaneously engaging users in the policy-setting
process through a novel, adaptive approach.

### [14] [Rounding-Guided Backdoor Injection in Deep Learning Model Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09647)
*Xiangxiang Chen,Peixin Zhang,Jun Sun,Wenhai Wang,Jingyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: QuRA is a novel backdoor attack exploiting model quantization to embed malicious behaviors without significant performance degradation, achieving near 100% success rates while bypassing existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model quantization introduces overlooked security risks, necessitating the investigation of adversarial techniques that abuse this deployment method.

Method: QuRA uses a weight selection strategy to identify critical weights influencing backdoor targets, followed by rounding direction optimization to amplify the backdoor effect across layers without accuracy loss.

Result: Experiments demonstrate 100% attack success rates in most cases with negligible performance degradation, plus effective bypass of existing backdoor defenses.

Conclusion: The work reveals critical vulnerabilities in model quantization processes, urging stronger security measures for deployment pipelines.

Abstract: Model quantization is a popular technique for deploying deep learning models
on resource-constrained environments. However, it may also introduce previously
overlooked security risks. In this work, we present QuRA, a novel backdoor
attack that exploits model quantization to embed malicious behaviors. Unlike
conventional backdoor attacks relying on training data poisoning or model
training manipulation, QuRA solely works using the quantization operations. In
particular, QuRA first employs a novel weight selection strategy to identify
critical weights that influence the backdoor target (with the goal of
perserving the model's overall performance in mind). Then, by optimizing the
rounding direction of these weights, we amplify the backdoor effect across
model layers without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
QuRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates in most cases, with negligible
performance degradation. Furthermore, we show that QuRA can adapt to bypass
existing backdoor defenses, underscoring its threat potential. Our findings

### [16] [Data Provenance Auditing of Fine-Tuned Large Language Models with a Text-Preserving Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09655)
*Yanming Li,Seifeddine Ghozzi,Cédric Eichler,Nicolas Anciaux,Alexandra Bensamoun,Lorena Gonzalez Manzano*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a text-preserving watermarking framework to audit if sensitive/copyrighted texts were used in fine-tuning LLMs under black-box access. It uses invisible Unicode characters split into cue-reply pairs, enabling reliable memorization detection with bounded false-positive rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like verbatim regurgitation and membership inference are unreliable for individual document auditing or require text alterations. A non-invasive, scalable solution is needed to verify model training data provenance.

Method: The framework embeds invisible Unicode watermarks into documents, splitting each into a cue (odd chunks) and reply (even chunks). Audits use cue-containing prompts; model outputs with corresponding replies indicate memorization. A ranking test with counterfactual watermarks ensures sound decisions with provable false-positive-rate bounds.

Result: Experiments show <0.1％ failure rate detecting replies after 50 marked documents, 100％ TPR@0％ FPR in 18k challenges, and >45％ per-document detection rates even when marked data <0.33％ of total training data. Robustness to passive transformations and scalability are demonstrated.

Conclusion: The watermarking framework provides minimally invasive, scalable, and robust auditing of LLM training data provenance under black-box access, achieving reliable detection with strong statistical guarantees.

Abstract: We address the problem of auditing whether sensitive or copyrighted texts
were used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) under black-box access.
Prior signals-verbatim regurgitation and membership inference-are unreliable at
the level of individual documents or require altering the visible text. We
introduce a text-preserving watermarking framework that embeds sequences of
invisible Unicode characters into documents. Each watermark is split into a cue
(embedded in odd chunks) and a reply (embedded in even chunks). At audit time,
we submit prompts that contain only the cue; the presence of the corresponding
reply in the model's output provides evidence of memorization consistent with
training on the marked text. To obtain sound decisions, we compare the score of
the published watermark against a held-out set of counterfactual watermarks and
apply a ranking test with a provable false-positive-rate bound. The design is
(i) minimally invasive (no visible text changes), (ii) scalable to many users
and documents via a large watermark space and multi-watermark attribution, and
(iii) robust to common passive transformations. We evaluate on open-weight LLMs
and multiple text domains, analyzing regurgitation dynamics, sensitivity to
training set size, and interference under multiple concurrent watermarks. Our
results demonstrate reliable post-hoc provenance signals with bounded FPR under
black-box access. We experimentally observe a failure rate of less than 0.1\%
when detecting a reply after fine-tuning with 50 marked documents. Conversely,
no spurious reply was recovered in over 18,000 challenges, corresponding to a
100\%TPR@0\% FPR. Moreover, detection rates remain relatively stable as the
dataset size increases, maintaining a per-document detection rate above 45\%
even when the marked collection accounts for less than 0.33\% of the
fine-tuning data.

### [17] [Signing Right Away](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09656)
*Yejun Jang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The whitepaper introduces SRA, a security architecture for digital media to ensure the provenance and trustworthiness of captured images and videos by securing the imaging pipeline within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). It leverages a four-pillar model for confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and replay protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity synthetic media and hardware vulnerabilities in conventional imaging pipelines are causing a crisis of trust in digital content, as existing solutions like post-hoc classifiers and software signings do not effectively establish an unbreakable link to reality at the time of capture.

Method: SRA is built on a four-pillar security model, extending the MIPI Camera Security Framework (CSF) to secure the entire imaging pipeline within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). It leverages cryptographic sealing to create a C2PA-compliant final asset and implements an immutable, verifiable proof of origin for images and videos.

Result: SRA provides a solution that guarantees the trustworthiness of digital media at the capture stage, addresses hardware vulnerabilities, and offers a cryptographic proof of origin. The architecture and implementation roadmap have been validated through empirical prototyping.

Conclusion: SRA represents the essential 'last mile' in establishing content trust by ensuring the provenance of digital media from capture to digital signature. It is a foundational solution for industries that depend on reliable visual information, such as journalism, legal evidence, and insurance.

Abstract: The proliferation of high-fidelity synthetic media, coupled with exploitable
hardware vulnerabilities in conventional imaging pipelines, has precipitated a
crisis of trust in digital content. Existing countermeasures, from post-hoc
classifiers to software-based signing, fail to address the fundamental
challenge of establishing an unbreakable link to reality at the moment of
capture. This whitepaper introduces Signing Right Away (SRA), a comprehensive
security architecture that guarantees the provenance of digital media from
"silicon to silicon to signed file." SRA leverages a four-pillar security
model-Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Replay Protection, akin
to the MIPI Camera Security Framework (CSF), but also extends its scope beyond
the internal data bus to the creation of a cryptographically sealed,
C2PA-compliant final asset. By securing the entire imaging pipeline within a
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), SRA ensures that every captured image and
video carries an immutable, verifiable proof of origin. This provides a
foundational solution for industries reliant on trustworthy visual information,
including journalism, legal evidence, and insurance. We present the SRA
architecture, a detailed implementation roadmap informed by empirical
prototyping, and a comparative analysis that positions SRA as the essential
"last mile" in the chain of content trust.

TL;DR: Core Mondrian is a scalable and modular extension of Original Mondrian. It provides enhanced utility and performance through parallel processing, resulting in better privacy metrics and faster execution


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind Core Mondrian is to address the need for scalable and efficient data anonymization for privacy-compliant equity analytics. By improving the Original Mondrian algorithm, the research aims to handle larger datasets while maintaining or enhancing utility.

Method: Core Mondrian utilizes a modular strategy layer that supports k-anonymity and allows for the easy addition of new privacy models. The framework implements a hybrid recursive/queue execution engine to exploit multi-core parallelism and maintain deterministic output. Key utility-preserving enhancements include NaN-pattern pre-partitioning, metric-driven cut scoring, and dynamic suppression budget management.

Result: Experiments on the UCI Adult dataset (48k records) and scaled versions (up to 1M records) show that Core Mondrian achieves lower discernibility metric scores than Original Mondrian when dealing with numeric quasi-identifier sets. Additionally, parallel processing provided a speedup of up to 4 times compared to sequential Core Mondrian.

Conclusion: Core Mondrian successfully delivers a more scalable, performant, and utility-preserving version of the Original Mondrian algorithm, making it suitable for privacy-compliant equity analytics in large-scale production environments.

Abstract: We present Core Mondrian, a scalable extension of the Original Mondrian
partition-based anonymization algorithm. A modular strategy layer supports
k-anonymity, allowing new privacy models to be added easily. A hybrid

*Raju Dhakal,Prashant Shekhar,Laxima Niure Kandel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A CNN-based RFF framework is proposed to authenticate devices by detecting rogue ones using softmax thresholding, validated against GAN-simulated attacks on SDR IQ samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Device authentication remains vulnerable to adversaries mimicking hardware imperfections. Effective RFF methods are needed to distinguish genuine from rogue devices in dynamic attack scenarios.

Method: The framework employs a CNN trained on IQ samples to classify devices. Softmax probability thresholds identify rogues, while a GAN simulates adversarial attacks by learning from genuine SDR data.

Result: Testing on ten ADALM-PLUTO SDRs (7 genuine, 2 rogue, 1 validation) demonstrated the CNN’s efficacy in detection. Metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1-score confirmed robustness against GAN-generated spoofing attempts.

Conclusion: The CNN-based RFF approach effectively identifies rogue devices even under adversarial GAN-based attacks, emphasizing the need for advanced machine learning defenses in secure communication systems.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) has evolved as an effective solution for
authenticating devices by leveraging the unique imperfections in hardware
components involved in the signal generation process. In this work, we propose
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework for detecting rogue
devices and identifying genuine ones using softmax probability thresholding. We
emulate an attack scenario in which adversaries attempt to mimic the RF
characteristics of genuine devices by training a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) using In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) samples from genuine devices. The
proposed approach is verified using IQ samples collected from ten different
ADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radios (SDRs), with seven devices considered
genuine, two as rogue, and one used for validation to determine the threshold.

### [20] [Pingmark: A Textual Protocol for Universal Spatial Mentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09672)
*Kalin Dimitrov*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Pingmark proposes a universal !@ protocol for spatial context in text, enabling location mentions like social media @references without proprietary maps or data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing location sharing relies on coordinates or map services that break when links expire, require permissions, and lack standardized syntax for spatial mentions in text.

Method: Introduces !@ as a semantic trigger converting to resolver URLs (https://pingmark.me/lat/lon/[timestamp]) using open mapping APIs, with local ephemeral data generation and no registration requirements.

Result: PPS v0.1 specification, functional resolver implementation, and roadmap toward open standard adoption for spatial mentions in online communication.

Conclusion: Pingmark establishes a privacy-focused, decentralized framework for location referencing that could revolutionize spatial information sharing in social media and text-based platforms.

Abstract: Pingmark defines a universal textual protocol for expressing spatial context
through a minimal symbol: !@. Rather than embedding coordinates or using
proprietary map links, Pingmark introduces a semantic trigger that compliant
client applications interpret to generate a standardized resolver link of the
form https://pingmark.me/lat/lon/[timestamp]. This allows location expression
to function like existing textual conventions - @ for identity or # for topics
- but for physical space. The protocol requires no user registration, relies on
open mapping technologies, and protects privacy by generating location data
ephemerally and locally. This paper presents the motivation, syntax, and design
of the Pingmark Protocol Specification (PPS v0.1), its reference resolver
implementation, and the long-term goal of establishing Pingmark as an open
Internet standard for spatial mentions.

*Khaoula Sghaier,Badis Hammi,Ghada Gharbi,Pierre Merdrignac,Pierre Parrend,Didier Verna*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper provides an overview of the Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) ecosystem and enabling technologies. It discusses the cybersecurity challenges and introduces a novel layered taxonomy for understanding cyberattack entry points in SDVs, analyzing representative studies through this taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As SDVs integrate with outsourced apps and allow continuous OTA updates, they require robust cybersecurity and resilience. Current CAV research lacks distinction between SDVs and non-SDVs and consolidation of cybersecurity efforts. SDVs' connectivity and software-centric nature increase their attack surface and vulnerabilities, necessitating focused research.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive examination of SDVs, their architecture and operation. It introduces a layered taxonomy, mapping concrete exploit techniques onto SDV properties and attack paths. This taxonomy is used to analyze representative research works and experimental approaches.

Result: The analysis shows the utility of the proposed layered taxonomy in mapping and examining exploit techniques. It identifies key attack vectors within SDV architecture and operation and classifies current research studies based on the taxonomy.

Conclusion: The paper contributes by providing a conceptual model of SDVs, determining their cybersecurity challenges, and introducing a practical taxonomy. This taxonomy helps assess, compare, and develop security research and countermeasures for SDVs, offering a roadmap for future research in the field.

Abstract: Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) introduce innovative features that extend
the vehicle's lifecycle through the integration of outsourced applications and
continuous Over-The-Air (OTA) updates. This shift necessitates robust
cybersecurity and system resilience. While research on Connected and Autonomous
Vehicles (CAV) has been extensive, there is a lack of clarity in distinguishing
SDVs from non-SDVs and a need to consolidate cybersecurity research. SDVs, with
their extensive connectivity, have a broader attack surface. Besides, their
software-centric nature introduces additional vulnerabilities. This paper
provides a comprehensive examination of SDVs, detailing their ecosystem,
enabling technologies, and the principal cyberattack entry points that arise
from their architectural and operational characteristics. We also introduce a
novel, layered taxonomy that maps concrete exploit techniques onto core SDV
properties and attack paths, and use it to analyze representative studies and
experimental approaches.

### [23] [Fortifying LLM-Based Code Generation with Graph-Based Reasoning on Secure Coding Practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09682)
*Rupam Patir,Keyan Guo,Haipeng Cai,Hongxin Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents GRASP, a method that enhances the security of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying structured reasoning using an SCP graph, improving across-the-board security rates and handling zero-day vulnerabilities effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The code generation power of LLMs has revolutionized software development, but it also introduces risks because the code they produce can have vulnerabilities. Current research aims to enhance LLMs via additional training or static analyzers, yet these approaches are resource-intensive, less adaptable to new threats, and not suitable for proprietary models.

Method: GRASP organizes Secure Coding Practices (SCPs) into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents dependencies and relationships. It leverages a graph-based reasoning process during code generation, guiding LLMs through the SCPs in a structured manner without requiring further training or external feedback.

Result: GRASP improves security rates across multiple LLMs, consistently achieving over 80% success, with up to 88% improvements over baseline methods in combating zero-day vulnerabilities, showcasing its effectiveness and adaptability.

Conclusion: GRASP offers an interpretable, model-agnostic solution to enhance the security of code generated by LLMs. By focusing on structured reasoning over SCP graphs, it achieves notable improvements and is applicable to various models, including proprietary ones, without the need for extra training.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
transformed the field of software development. However, this advancement also
presents significant security challenges, as LLM-generated code often contains
vulnerabilities. One direction of research strengthens LLMs by injecting or
refining security knowledge through curated datasets, model tuning, or static
analyzers. While effective in certain settings, these methods can be
resource-intensive, less adaptable to zero-day vulnerabilities, and often
inapplicable to proprietary models. To address these challenges, we introduce
GRASP, which explores a new direction that focuses on structured reasoning over
Secure Coding Practices(SCPs) rather than additional training or external
feedback. GRASP comprises two key ideas: (1) an SCP graph that organizes SCPs
into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) capturing dependencies and relationships,
and (2) a graph-based reasoning process that systematically guides LLMs through
relevant SCPs for code generation. This design enables interpretable,
model-agnostic, and scalable security improvements, particularly for previously
unseen vulnerabilities. Our evaluation shows that GRASP consistently achieves
Security Rates (SR) exceeding 80% across multiple LLMs, and delivers up to 88%
improvements over baselines on zero-day vulnerabilities.

*Haoran Ou,Kangjie Chen,Xingshuo Han,Gelei Deng,Jie Zhang,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CREST-Search, a red teaming framework for websearch-augmented LLMs that generates and refines adversarial queries to expose vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: They argue that current LLM research has not systematically studied the unique risks introduced by the integration of web search, creating a need for better safety testing methods.

Method: They develop CREST-Search, which uses in-context learning to create initial adversarial search queries and then iteratively improves them using structured feedback. They also create the WebSearch-Harm dataset for training red-teaming agents.

Result: Experiments show CREST-Search successfully bypasses existing safety filters and uncovers multiple vulnerabilities in real-world websearch-enhanced LLM systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that existing safety measures are insufficient for search-enabled LLMs, and new specialized defenses are crucial for safe deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks such as dialogue, summarization,
and question answering, yet they struggle to adapt to specialized domains and
evolving facts. To overcome this, web search has been integrated into LLMs,
allowing real-time access to online content. However, this connection magnifies
safety risks, as adversarial prompts combined with untrusted sources can cause
severe vulnerabilities. We investigate red teaming for LLMs with web search and
present CREST-Search, a framework that systematically exposes risks in such
systems. Unlike existing methods for standalone LLMs, CREST-Search addresses
the complex workflow of search-enabled models by generating adversarial queries
with in-context learning and refining them through iterative feedback. We
further construct WebSearch-Harm, a search-specific dataset to fine-tune LLMs
into efficient red-teaming agents. Experiments show that CREST-Search
effectively bypasses safety filters and reveals vulnerabilities in modern
web-augmented LLMs, underscoring the need for specialized defenses to ensure
trustworthy deployment.

### [25] [A Semantic Model for Audit of Cloud Engines based on ISO/IEC TR 3445:2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09690)
*Morteza Sargolzaei Javan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified semantic model for cloud systems by integrating architectural standards (ISO/IEC 22123) with security/compliance standards (ISO/IEC 27001:2022, ISO/IEC TR 3445:2022). The RDF/Turtle model enables semantic reasoning, compliance validation, and vendor-neutral design, validated through OpenStack/AWS case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud computing lacks unified frameworks for architecture and compliance, hindering interoperability, auditability, and security. Existing standards are siloed, creating gaps in practical implementation and validation.

Method: 1. Decomposes cloud systems into Control, Business, Audit, and Data interfaces. 2. Integrates ISO security controls with architectural taxonomy via a security ontology. 3. Implements model using RDF/Turtle for semantic reasoning. 4. Demonstrates compliance validation through SPARQL/SHACL workflows.

Result: Case studies with OpenStack and AWS demonstrate model applicability. Validation workflows achieve automated compliance checks. The framework enables vendor-neutral architecture design and semantic interoperability between standards.

Conclusion: The work bridges architectural and compliance standards for cloud systems, addressing auditability and interoperation challenges. The semantic model provides a foundation for automated compliance validation and cross-vendor architecture modeling.

Abstract: Cloud computing has become the foundation of modern digital infrastructure,
yet the absence of a unified architectural and compliance framework impedes
interoperability, auditability, and robust security. This paper introduces a
formal, machine-readable semantic model for Cloud Engines, integrating the
architectural taxonomy of ISO/IEC 22123 (Cloud Reference Architecture) with the
security and compliance controls of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and ISO/IEC TR
3445:2022. The model decomposes cloud systems into four canonical
interfaces--Control, Business, Audit, and Data--and extends them with a
security ontology that maps mechanisms such as authentication, authorization,
and encryption to specific compliance controls. Expressed in RDF/Turtle, the
model enables semantic reasoning, automated compliance validation, and
vendor-neutral architecture design. We demonstrate its practical utility
through OpenStack and AWS case studies, and provide reproducible validation
workflows using SPARQL and SHACL. This work advances the state of cloud
security modeling by bridging architectural and compliance standards in a
unified framework, with a particular emphasis on auditability.

### [26] [VisualDAN: Exposing Vulnerabilities in VLMs with Visual-Driven DAN Commands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09699)
*Aofan Liu,Lulu Tang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces VisualDAN, an adversarial image exploiting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate harmful outputs via hijacked visual content, exposing critical security vulnerabilities in multimodal AI alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of additional modalities in VLMs creates novel vulnerabilities like image hijacking, which can bypass existing safeguards and produce ethically problematic outputs, highlighting a critical gap in multimodal security research.

Method: VisualDAN uses a single adversarial image encoded with DAN-style commands (e.g., 'Sure, I can...') to prepend malicious queries. The image is trained on toxic corpora with affirmative prefixes, transforming visual inputs into text instructions that trick models into circumventing ethical constraints.

Result: Experiments on MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA show VisualDAN successfully bypasses VLM defenses, enabling 78-93% of harmful instruction execution. Even minimal toxic content amplifies malicious outputs post-defense-compromise, demonstrating systemic vulnerability.

Conclusion: The work underscores the urgency of developing multimodal-specific defenses against image-based jailbreaks, while providing empirical evidence of alignment fragility in VLMs to guide future security research directions.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered significant attention for their
remarkable ability to interpret and generate multimodal content. However,
securing these models against jailbreak attacks continues to be a substantial
challenge. Unlike text-only models, VLMs integrate additional modalities,
introducing novel vulnerabilities such as image hijacking, which can manipulate
the model into producing inappropriate or harmful responses. Drawing
inspiration from text-based jailbreaks like the "Do Anything Now" (DAN)
command, this work introduces VisualDAN, a single adversarial image embedded
with DAN-style commands. Specifically, we prepend harmful corpora with
affirmative prefixes (e.g., "Sure, I can provide the guidance you need") to
trick the model into responding positively to malicious queries. The
adversarial image is then trained on these DAN-inspired harmful texts and
transformed into the text domain to elicit malicious outputs. Extensive
experiments on models such as MiniGPT-4, MiniGPT-v2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA
reveal that VisualDAN effectively bypasses the safeguards of aligned VLMs,
forcing them to execute a broad range of harmful instructions that severely
violate ethical standards. Our results further demonstrate that even a small
amount of toxic content can significantly amplify harmful outputs once the
model's defenses are compromised. These findings highlight the urgent need for
robust defenses against image-based attacks and offer critical insights for
future research into the alignment and security of VLMs.

*Md Habibur Rahman,Md Sharif Hossen,Nathan H. Stephenson,Vijay K. Shah,Aloizio Da Silva*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SAJD is a self-adaptive jammer detection framework for O-RAN environments using AI/ML, improving accuracy and adaptability in dynamic interference scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN's security vulnerabilities, like jamming attacks, require autonomous detection solutions to maintain network performance and security without manual intervention.

Method: SAJD employs a closed-loop system with ML-based xApp for near-realtime jamming inference and rApps for continuous monitoring and retraining, evaluated on an O-RAN-compliant testbed.

Result: SAJD outperforms existing jamming detection xApps in accuracy and adaptability under dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios.

Conclusion: SAJD provides a robust, autonomous solution for jamming detection in O-RAN, enhancing resilience against evolving threats through self-adaptive ML frameworks.

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and
programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined
networking, network function virtualization, and implementation of standardized
open interfaces. However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN, which can
severely undermine network performance, is jamming attacks. This paper presents
SAJD- a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects
jamming attacks in AI/ML framework-integrated ORAN environments without human
intervention. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes
near-realtime inference of radio signal jamming via our developed ML-based
xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps.
In this demonstration, we will show how SAJD outperforms state-of-the-art
jamming detection xApp (offline trained with manual labels) in terms of
accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen
interference scenarios in the O-RAN-compliant testbed.

### [29] [A Scalable, Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Identity and Verifiable Data Sharing Framework based on Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09715)
*Hui Yuan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining DIDs and VCs with ZKPs for privacy in DApps, offering protocols for conditions, revocation using accumulators, and social key recovery. It shows better prover efficiency and security than existing systems with a trade-off in proof size, validated in a DeFi credit study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conflict between blockchain transparency and user data privacy is growing due to increased DApps usage. Existing solutions like DID and VC lack robust privacy-verified mechanisms and efficiency in large-scale applications.

Method: We design a framework which integrates DIDs and VCs in combination with efficient ZKP schemes, particularly using zk-STARKs to construct privacy-preserving protocols, cryptographic accumulators for credential revocation, and a social key recovery method. A prototype implementation is provided to evaluate performance in proof generation, verification, and on-chain costs.

Result: Our framework improves prover efficiency for complex computations over zk-SNARKs, using larger proof sizes, while providing stronger security with no trusted setup and post-quantum resilience. The DeFi credit scoring case study shows potential for capital efficiency and data economy trust.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the issue of privacy and identity verification in the blockchain. It provides a highly secure and efficient solution based on ZKPs and accumulators, with the scalability needed for large systems and enhanced system usability. The outcome of this work has a broad impact on DeFi and other data economy scenarios.

Abstract: With the proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps), the conflict
between the transparency of blockchain technology and user data privacy has
become increasingly prominent. While Decentralized Identity (DID) and
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) provide a standardized framework for user data
sovereignty, achieving trusted identity verification and data sharing without
compromising privacy remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a
novel, comprehensive framework that integrates DIDs and VCs with efficient
Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes to address this core issue. The key
contributions of this framework are threefold: first, it constructs a set of
strong privacy-preserving protocols based on zk-STARKs, allowing users to prove
that their credentials satisfy specific conditions (e.g., "age is over 18")
without revealing any underlying sensitive data. Second, it designs a scalable,
privacy-preserving credential revocation mechanism based on cryptographic
accumulators, effectively solving credential management challenges in
large-scale scenarios. Finally, it integrates a practical social key recovery
scheme, significantly enhancing system usability and security. Through a
prototype implementation and performance evaluation, this paper quantitatively
analyzes the framework's performance in terms of proof generation time,
verification overhead, and on-chain costs. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art systems based on zk-SNARKs, our framework, at the cost of a
larger proof size, significantly improves prover efficiency for complex
computations and provides stronger security guarantees, including no trusted
setup and post-quantum security. Finally, a case study in the decentralized
finance (DeFi) credit scoring scenario demonstrates the framework's immense
potential for unlocking capital efficiency and fostering a trusted data
economy.

### [30] [Zk-SNARK Marketplace with Proof of Useful Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09729)
*Samuel Oleksak,Richard Gazdik,Martin Peresini,Ivan Homoliak*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) consensus protocol that embeds chain integrity and miner identity into zero-knowledge (zk-SNARKs) proof generation, dual-purpose solving blockchain security while enabling a decentralized marketplace for outsourced cryptographic proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proof of Work (PoW)'s energy inefficiency motivates PoUW alternatives, but prior proposals fail to securely integrate chain integrity and miner identity into useful work, leaving them vulnerable. The need for a decentralized solution to outsource expensive zk-SNARK proofs also remains unmet.

Method: The protocol requires miners to generate client-outsource zk-SNARKs proofs as consensus work, simultaneously validating the blockchain and fulfilling proof outsourcing requests. A decentralized marketplace at the consensus layer is designed to match client requests with miner capabilities.

Result: The protocol meets all necessary PoW security properties while enabling practical, privacy-preserving proof outsourcing at the consensus layer. The first decentralized marketplace operating at the consensus layer is implemented, demonstrating dual value creation.

Conclusion: By integrating blockchain security and proof outsourcing through zk-SNARKs, the protocol overcomes prior PoUW limitations and establishes a framework for sustainable consensus models that produce dual economic and computational value.

Abstract: Proof of Work (PoW) is widely regarded as the most secure permissionless
blockchain consensus protocol. However, its reliance on computationally
intensive yet externally useless puzzles results in excessive electric energy
wasting. To alleviate this, Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) has been explored as an
alternative to secure blockchain platforms while also producing real-world
value. Despite this promise, existing PoUW proposals often fail to embed the
integrity of the chain and identity of the miner into the puzzle solutions, not
meeting necessary requirements for PoW and thus rendering them vulnerable. In
this work, we propose a PoUW consensus protocol that computes client-outsourced
zk-SNARKs proofs as a byproduct, which are at the same time used to secure the
consensus protocol. We further leverage this mechanism to design a
decentralized marketplace for outsourcing zk-SNARK proof generation, which is,
to the best of our knowledge, the first such marketplace operating at the
consensus layer, while meeting all necessary properties of PoW.

### [31] [Secret-Key Agreement Through Hidden Markov Modeling of Wavelet Scattering Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09773)
*Nora Basha,Bechir Hamdaoui,Attila A. Yavuz,Thang Hoang,Mehran Mozaffari Kermani*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel secret-key generation method for IoT networks using wavelet scattering networks and hidden Markov models, achieving a 5x improvement in key generation rate over traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing secret-key generation methods rely on fragile channel reciprocity through instantaneous measurements, which are vulnerable to noise, asynchronous sampling, fading, and quantization errors, leading to poor performance in practical IoT scenarios.

Method: The approach uses wavelet scattering networks to extract robust CSI features, applies dimensionality reduction to reveal cluster structures, and employs hidden Markov models for key agreement without quantization to preserve channel randomness.

Result: The method achieves a 5× improvement in key generation rate compared to traditional benchmarks while maintaining security and efficiency in noisy, resource-constrained IoT environments.

Conclusion: The proposed technique overcomes limitations of existing methods by leveraging robust feature extraction and probabilistic modeling, offering a secure and efficient solution for IoT key generation.

Abstract: Secret-key generation and agreement based on wireless channel reciprocity
offers a promising avenue for securing IoT networks. However, existing
approaches predominantly rely on the similarity of instantaneous channel
measurement samples between communicating devices. This narrow view of
reciprocity is often impractical, as it is highly susceptible to noise,
asynchronous sampling, channel fading, and other system-level imperfections --
all of which significantly impair key generation performance. Furthermore, the
quantization step common in traditional schemes introduces irreversible errors,
further limiting efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach for
secret-key generation by using wavelet scattering networks to extract robust
and reciprocal CSI features. Dimensionality reduction is applied to uncover
hidden cluster structures, which are then used to build hidden Markov models
for efficient key agreement. Our approach eliminates the need for quantization
and effectively captures channel randomness. It achieves a 5x improvement in
key generation rate compared to traditional benchmarks, providing a secure and
efficient solution for key generation in resource-constrained IoT environments.

### [32] [HTTP Request Synchronization Defeats Discrepancy Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09952)
*Cem Topcuoglu,Kaan Onarlioglu,Steven Sprecher,Engin Kirda*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces HTTP Request Synchronization, the first systemic defense against discrepancy attacks in proxy-based web architectures. By tracking and validating request processing across proxy chains, it prevents vulnerabilities like cache poisoning and smuggling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proxy services often process HTTP requests inconsistently due to complexity and vendor decisions, enabling discrepancy attacks (e.g., cache poisoning, smuggling). Existing solutions lack systematic address of this issue.

Method: Proposes HTTP Request Synchronization: augments requests with a processing history via standard HTTP extensions, which proxies validate for consistency. Implemented across Apache, NGINX, HAProxy, Varnish, and Cloudflare.

Result: Demonstrates practical implementation on five major proxy technologies, showing effectiveness in eliminating processing discrepancies through synchronized validation.

Conclusion: HTTP Request Synchronization provides a scalable, implementable defense against a critical class of proxy-based vulnerabilities, with broad compatibility across core web infrastructure.

Abstract: Contemporary web application architectures involve many layers of proxy
services that process traffic. Due to the complexity of HTTP and vendor design
decisions, these proxies sometimes process a given request in different ways.
Attackers can exploit these processing discrepancies to launch damaging attacks
including web cache poisoning and request smuggling. Discrepancy attacks are
surging, yet, there exists no systemic defense.
  In this work, we propose the first comprehensive defense to address this
problem, called HTTP Request Synchronization. Our scheme uses standard HTTP
extension mechanisms to augment each request with a complete processing
history. It propagates this context through the traffic path detailing how each
server hop has processed said request. Using this history, every proxy server
can validate that their processing is consistent with all previous hops,
eliminating discrepancy attacks. We implement our scheme for 5 popular proxy
technologies, Apache, NGINX, HAProxy, Varnish, and Cloudflare, demonstrating
its practical impact.

TL;DR: Prismo is an open-source recommendation system that helps developers select optimal privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) frameworks and parameters by modeling use cases as linear integer programming problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face significant challenges in choosing the right PPML framework and parameters due to complex trade-offs between computational efficiency, security, and scalability.

Method: Prismo models each use case as a Linear Integer Programming optimization problem, incorporating constraints like number of parties and computational costs to recommend tailored solutions. It automates framework filtering based on user-defined objectives.

Result: Evaluation across multiple use cases demonstrates Prismo's ability to deliver best-fit PPML solutions for diverse deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: Prismo addresses the critical need for scenario-specific PPML framework selection and provides practical, optimized solutions for security and privacy applications.

Abstract: Machine learning has become a crucial part of our lives, with applications
spanning nearly every aspect of our daily activities. However, using personal
information in machine learning applications has sparked significant security
and privacy concerns about user data. To address these challenges, different
privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) frameworks have been developed to
protect sensitive information in machine learning applications. These
frameworks generally attempt to balance design trade-offs such as computational
efficiency, communication overhead, security guarantees, and scalability.
Despite the advancements, selecting the optimal framework and parameters for
specific deployment scenarios remains a complex and critical challenge for
privacy and security application developers.
  We present Prismo, an open-source recommendation system designed to aid in
selecting optimal parameters and frameworks for different PPML application
scenarios. Prismo enables users to explore a comprehensive space of PPML
frameworks through various properties based on user-defined objectives. It
supports automated filtering of suitable candidate frameworks by considering
parameters such as the number of parties in multi-party computation or
federated learning and computation cost constraints in homomorphic encryption.
Prismo models every use case into a Linear Integer Programming optimization
problem, ensuring tailored solutions are recommended for each scenario. We
evaluate Prismo's effectiveness through multiple use cases, demonstrating its
ability to deliver best-fit solutions in different deployment scenarios.

### [34] [SecureWebArena: A Holistic Security Evaluation Benchmark for LVLM-based Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10073)
*Zonghao Ying,Yangguang Shao,Jianle Gan,Gan Xu,Junjie Shen,Wenxin Zhang,Quanchen Zou,Junzheng Shi,Zhenfei Yin,Mingchuan Zhang,Aishan Liu,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces \tool{}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating security of LVLM-based web agents, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by providing 6 simulated environments, 2,970 trajectories, attack vector taxonomy, and multi-layered evaluation protocol across three dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing security benchmarks for LVLM web agents offer limited coverage, focusing on narrow scenarios like user-level prompt manipulation, which fails to capture the full spectrum of vulnerabilities in real-world deployments.

Method: \tool{} proposes: (1)a unified evaluation suite with 6 realistic web environments and diverse attack vectors; (2)a multi-layered protocol analyzing failures in reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task outcome; (3)a dataset of 2,970 trajectories and structured attack taxonomy spanning both user/environment-level manipulations.

Result: Experiments on 9 representative LVLMs across 3 categories reveal persistent vulnerabilities to adversarial manipulations and critical trade-offs between model specialization and security, demonstrating the benchmark's effectiveness in exposing security risks beyond simple success metrics.

Conclusion: \tool{} establishes foundational infrastructure for trustworthy web agent development by providing (1)a comprehensive security benchmark with diverse environments and evaluation pipeline; (2)new insights into security-specialization trade-offs in modern LVLMs, while highlighting persistent vulnerabilities requiring mitigation.

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful
tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world
environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of
security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial
coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt
manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic
benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first
introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic
web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes
2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The
suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both
user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a
multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three
critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task
outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple
success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9
representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose,
agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents
are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal
critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1)
a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered
evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of
modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing
trustworthy web agent deployment.

### [35] [Pharmacist: Safety Alignment Data Curation for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10085)
*Guozhi Liu,Qi Mu,Tiansheng Huang,Xinhua Wang,Li Shen,Weiwei Lin,Zhang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Pharmacist, a safety alignment data curation method for large language models. It enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by selecting high-quality, safety-critical data subsets, improving alignment-stage defense performance and computational efficiency while being compatible with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment-stage defense methods for LLMs (e.g., Vaccine, RepNoise) overlook the critical impact of original safety-alignment dataset quality. Their performance is restricted by the dataset's composition, motivating the need for improved data curation.

Method: Pharmacist trains an alignment data selector to rank and filter alignment data by up-ranking high-quality/safety-critical examples and down-ranking low-quality/non-critical ones, creating optimized subsets for training.

Result: Models trained on Pharmacist-curated datasets outperform baselines in defense and inference performance (3.50% and 1.10% improvements) when combined with RepNoise/T-Vaccine, while reducing training time by 56.83% and 57.63%, respectively.

Conclusion: Pharmacist's data curation approach significantly improves alignment-stage defense effectiveness and efficiency. It demonstrates that prioritizing safety-critical data quality enhances compatibility and performance when integrated with existing defense frameworks.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issues present significant safety challenges for
fine-tuning-as-a-service in large language models. Existing alignment-stage
defenses, e.g., Vaccine, Repnoise, Booster, and T-Vaccine, mitigate harmful
fine-tuning issues by enhancing the model's robustness during the alignment
phase. While these methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue, they often
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. We observe that their defense performance and computational efficiency
remain constrained by the quality and composition of the alignment dataset. To
address this limitation, we propose Pharmacist, a safety alignment data
curation solution that enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by
selecting a high-quality and safety-critical core subset from the original
alignment data. The core idea of Pharmacist is to train an alignment data
selector to rank alignment data. Specifically, up-ranking high-quality and
safety-critical alignment data, down-ranking low-quality and
non-safety-critical data. Empirical results indicate that models trained on
datasets selected by Pharmacist outperform those trained on datasets selected
by existing selection methods in both defense and inference performance. In
addition, Pharmacist can be effectively integrated with mainstream
alignment-stage defense methods. For example, when applied to RepNoise and
T-Vaccine, using the dataset selected by Pharmacist instead of the full dataset
leads to improvements in defense performance by 2.60\% and 3.30\%,
respectively, and enhances inference performance by 3.50\% and 1.10\%. Notably,
it reduces training time by 56.83\% and 57.63\%, respectively. Our code is

### [36] [PrediQL: Automated Testing of GraphQL APIs with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10407)
*Shaolun Liu,Sina Marefat,Omar Tsai,Yu Chen,Zecheng Deng,Jia Wang,Mohammad A. Tayebi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PrediQL is a retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs that combines adaptive feedback loops and multi-armed bandit strategies to achieve higher coverage and vulnerability discovery rates than existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphQL's nested dependencies and context-dependent vulnerabilities require advanced testing methods beyond random/pattern-based fuzzers, which fail to adapt to dynamic schema structures and contextual errors.

Method: 1) Uses LLM reasoning for semantically valid query generation
2a) Multi-armed bandit approach balances exploration/exploitation
2b), 3) Adaptive feedback via trace reuse and schema context
4) Context-aware vulnerability detector interprets responses/errors through LLM analysis
5) Retrieval-augmented learning with execution traces/schema fragments

Result: Demonstrated significantly higher
- Code coverage across open-source/graphql-benchmark APIs
- Vulnerability detection (injection, access control bypass, info disclosure)
- 93% of bugs found confirmed by developers

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-guided generation with adaptive exploration and retrieval mechanisms transforms API security testing from reactive pattern matching to proactive, context-aware intelligent exploration.

Abstract: GraphQL's flexible query model and nested data dependencies expose APIs to
complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are difficult to uncover using
conventional testing tools. Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload
generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic
structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first
retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large
language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically
valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a
multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with
exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and
reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling
self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input
generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses
LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages,
and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control
bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and
benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher
coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented
reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from
reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.

### [37] [System Password Security: Attack and Defense Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10246)
*Chaofang Shi,Zhongwen Li,Xiaoqi Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper systematically analyzes system password security by evaluating common password cracking methods and defensive strategies. It conducts experiments using tools like John the Ripper and Hashcat to compare hash algorithm performance, password complexity strategies, and defense mechanisms such as salting, slow hashing algorithms, and multi-factor authentication, offering optimization recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent password cracking attacks threaten system security, necessitating research into effective defense strategies. The study aims to address this critical security gap through systematic analysis of attack methods and defensive technologies.

Method: 1. Experimental simulation of brute force/dictionary attacks using John the Ripper and Hashcat. 2. Analysis of 5 test datasets with MD5, SHA-256, and bcrypt hash functions. 3. Evaluation of defensive measures including hash algorithms, salting, account lockout policies, multi-factor authentication, and risk-adaptive authentication. 4. Comparative analysis of attack resistance and defense effectiveness.

Result: 1. Salting and slow hashing algorithms demonstrate significant defense effectiveness. 2. Bcrypt outperforms MD5 and SHA-256 in resisting attacks. 3. Account lockout policies and multi-factor authentication exhibit distinct safety-Usability trade-offs. 4. Risk-adaptive authentication shows potential to balance security and user experience.

Conclusion: The study confirms the importance of combining hash algorithm strength (e.g., bcrypt with salting) with complementary defense mechanisms like adaptive authentication. It recommends integrating multiple defensive strategies while optimizing password complexity requirements and real-time risk assessment techniques to enhance system password security.

Abstract: System passwords serve as critical credentials for user authentication and
access control when logging into operating systems or applications. Upon
entering a valid password, users pass verification to access system resources
and execute corresponding operations. In recent years, frequent password
cracking attacks targeting system passwords have posed a severe threat to
information system security. To address this challenge, in-depth research into
password cracking attack methods and defensive technologies holds significant
importance. This paper conducts systematic research on system password
security, focusing on analyzing typical password cracking methods such as brute
force attacks, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table attacks, while evaluating
the effectiveness of existing defensive measures. The experimental section
utilizes common cryptanalysis tools, such as John the Ripper and Hashcat, to
simulate brute force and dictionary attacks. Five test datasets, each generated
using Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5), Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA
256), and bcrypt hash functions, are analyzed. By comparing the overall
performance of different hash algorithms and password complexity strategies
against these attacks, the effectiveness of defensive measures such as salting
and slow hashing algorithms is validated. Building upon this foundation, this
paper further evaluates widely adopted defense mechanisms, including account
lockout policies, multi-factor authentication, and risk adaptive
authentication. By integrating experimental data with recent research findings,
it analyzes the strengths and limitations of each approach while proposing
feasible improvement recommendations and optimization strategies.

### [38] [MetaBreak: Jailbreaking Online LLM Services via Special Token Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10271)
*Wentian Zhu,Zhen Xiang,Wei Niu,Le Guan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes MetaBreak, a method to exploit special tokens in LLMs to bypass safety alignment and content moderation systems. It demonstrates that attack-embedded special tokens evade state-of-the-art defenses and synergizes with existing prompt engineering techniques to enhance attack effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety mechanisms fail to address vulnerabilities in special tokens used for conversation structuring during fine-tuning. The ability to bypass both internal alignment and external moderation systems presents significant security risks to LLM services.

Method: The authors: (1 ) Identify four attack primitive patterns using special tokens (2 ) Replace special tokens with semantically similar embeddings for evasion (3 ) Systematically test attacks on lab and commercial LLM platforms (4 ) Demonstrate synergies with prompt engineering methods like PAP/GPTFuzzer by combining attack strategies.

Result: MetaBreak achieves: (1 ) Competitive jailbreak rates with SOTA methods without content moderation (2 ) 11.6-34.8 percentage point improvement over PAP/GPTFuzzer with content moderation enabled (3 ) Additional 20-24% rate boosts when combined with existing prompt engineering techniques.

Conclusion: MetaBreak's unique attack strategy exposes critical gaps in current LLM defense mechanisms. The findings suggest that hybrid attacks combining special token exploitation with traditional prompt engineering create powerful synergies, necessitating fundamentally new defense approaches beyond token sanitization.

Abstract: Unlike regular tokens derived from existing text corpora, special tokens are
artificially created to annotate structured conversations during the
fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Serving as metadata of
training data, these tokens play a crucial role in instructing LLMs to generate
coherent and context-aware responses. We demonstrate that special tokens can be
exploited to construct four attack primitives, with which malicious users can
reliably bypass the internal safety alignment of online LLM services and
circumvent state-of-the-art (SOTA) external content moderation systems
simultaneously. Moreover, we found that addressing this threat is challenging,
as aggressive defense mechanisms-such as input sanitization by removing special
tokens entirely, as suggested in academia-are less effective than anticipated.
This is because such defense can be evaded when the special tokens are replaced
by regular ones with high semantic similarity within the tokenizer's embedding
space. We systemically evaluated our method, named MetaBreak, on both lab
environment and commercial LLM platforms. Our approach achieves jailbreak rates
comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering-based solutions when no content
moderation is deployed. However, when there is content moderation, MetaBreak
outperforms SOTA solutions PAP and GPTFuzzer by 11.6% and 34.8%, respectively.
Finally, since MetaBreak employs a fundamentally different strategy from prompt
engineering, the two approaches can work synergistically. Notably, empowering
MetaBreak on PAP and GPTFuzzer boosts jailbreak rates by 24.3% and 20.2%,
respectively.

*Guan-Yan Yang,Tzu-Yu Cheng,Ya-Wen Teng,Farn Wanga,Kuo-Hui Yeh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ArtPerception introduces a black-box jailbreak framework exploiting ASCII art to bypass LLM security measures via a two-phase methodology, demonstrating effectiveness across SOTA models and commercial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety alignments focus on semantic interpretation, leaving vulnerabilities to non-standard data representations like ASCII art, which can bypass detection mechanisms.

Method: A two-phase approach: (1 Phillip) model-specific pre-test to optimize ASCII recognition parameters, and (2 Phillip) one-shot attacks using Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD).

Result: ArtPerception achieves superior jailbreak performance on four open-source LLMs, transfers successfully to commercial models (GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek-V3), and demonstrates resilience against existing defenses.

Conclusion: LLM security must account for multi-modal text interpretations; strategic, reconnaissance-based attacks like ArtPerception highlight critical vulnerabilities in current safety frameworks.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications
has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security
challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic
interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data
representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box
jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the
security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that
rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic,
two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to
empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2
leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious
jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a
more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through
comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate
superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world
relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial
models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting
a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA
Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM
security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations,
even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic,
reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially
harmful and offensive model outputs.

TL;DR: This survey comprehensively analyzes post-quantum cryptography (PQC), covering taxonomy, performance, implementation, and deployment challenges, aiming to guide quantum-safe system design across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PQC is transitioning to deployment as NIST finalizes standards, requiring a bridge between theoretical foundations, engineering, and operational practices to ensure quantum-safe systems.

Method: The paper develops a taxonomy of PQC families (lattice, code, hash, etc.), compares performance/communication costs via implementations, reviews hardware acceleration and security, and examines protocol/integration, constrained environments, and quantum technology complementarity.

Result: The analysis highlights practical trade-offs in PQC performance, security, and deployment, including TLS/DNSSEC integration, hardware efficiency, and domain-specific challenges (IoT, blockchain). Open problems and migration strategies are emphasized.

Conclusion: The survey advocates crypto-agility and hybrid approaches, identifies open challenges (leakage resilience, parameter agility), and provides evidence-based guidance for operators, serving as a reference for bridging research and deployment in quantum-safe systems.

Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is moving from evaluation to deployment as
NIST finalizes standards for ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA. This survey maps the
space from foundations to practice. We first develop a taxonomy across
lattice-, code-, hash-, multivariate-, isogeny-, and MPC-in-the-Head families,
summarizing security assumptions, cryptanalysis, and standardization status. We
then compare performance and communication costs using representative,
implementation-grounded measurements, and review hardware acceleration (AVX2,
FPGA/ASIC) and implementation security with a focus on side-channel resistance.
Building upward, we examine protocol integration (TLS, DNSSEC), PKI and
certificate hygiene, and deployment in constrained and high-assurance
environments (IoT, cloud, finance, blockchain). We also discuss complementarity
with quantum technologies (QKD, QRNGs) and the limits of near-term quantum
computing. Throughout, we emphasize crypto-agility, hybrid migration, and
evidence-based guidance for operators. We conclude with open problems spanning
parameter agility, leakage-resilient implementations, and domain-specific
rollout playbooks. This survey aims to be a practical reference for researchers
and practitioners planning quantum-safe systems, bridging standards,
engineering, and operations.

### [41] [SASER: Stego attacks on open-source LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10486)
*Ming Tan,Wei Li,Hu Tao,Hailong Ma,Aodi Liu,Qian Chen,Zilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes SASER, a novel steganographic attack on open-source LLMs that achieves 98.14% stealth rate and 100x attack success rate on quantized models, introducing a systematic threat model and performance-aware parameter targeting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LLMs' collaborative nature exposes them to understudied stego attacks from adversaries with internal knowledge during model sharing. Current attack models lack formalization and robustness against real-world deployment scenarios like quantization.

Method: 1) Constructs formal threat models categorizing adversary objectives/capabilities. 2/3) SASER identifies low-importance parameters, embeds/disguises triggers/payloads with de-quantization strategies. 4/5) Leverages performance-aware metrics to minimize model degradation and sequential execution for payload persistence across quantization.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA2-7B/ChatGLM3-6B show SASER: (1st) 98.14% higher stealth than existing stego attacks for DNNs (simultaneous 100x ASR on non-quantized models); (2nd) first to achieve 100x ASR on quantized models; (3rd) maintains SOTA stealth rates while matching or exceeding both existing stealth (89.3-98.3%) and ASR (88x-89x).

Conclusion: SASER demonstrates critical vulnerabilities in open-source LLMs against hybrid stego-poisoning attacks, particularly in real-world quantized deployments. The finding motivates urgent research on countermeasures combining parameter inspection frameworks, robustness certification, and secure model sharing protocols.

Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable
dominance over proprietary LLMs in resolving neural processing tasks, thanks to
the collaborative and sharing nature. Although full access to source codes,
model parameters, and training data lays the groundwork for transparency, we
argue that such a full-access manner is vulnerable to stego attacks, and their
ill-effects are not fully understood. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
formalization for stego attacks on open-source LLMs by enumerating all possible
threat models associated with adversary objectives, knowledge, and
capabilities. Therein, the threat posed by adversaries with internal knowledge,
who inject payloads and triggers during the model sharing phase, is of
practical interest. We go even further and propose the first stego attack on
open-source LLMs, dubbed SASER, which wields impacts through identifying
targeted parameters, embedding payloads, injecting triggers, and executing
payloads sequentially. Particularly, SASER enhances the attack robustness
against quantization-based local deployment by de-quantizing the embedded
payloads. In addition, to achieve stealthiness, SASER devises the
performance-aware importance metric to identify targeted parameters with the
least degradation of model performance. Extensive experiments on LlaMA2-7B and
ChatGLM3-6B, without quantization, show that the stealth rate of SASER
outperforms existing stego attacks (for general DNNs) by up to 98.1%, while
achieving the same attack success rate (ASR) of 100%. More importantly, SASER
improves ASR on quantized models from 0 to 100% in all settings. We appeal for
investigations on countermeasures against SASER in view of the significant
attack effectiveness.

### [42] [The Hidden DNA of LLM-Generated JavaScript: Structural Patterns Enable High-Accuracy Authorship Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10493)
*Norbert Tihanyi,Bilel Cherif,Richard A. Dubniczky,Mohamed Amine Ferrag,Tamás Bisztray*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents LLM-NodeJS, a dataset and methodology for authorship attribution of JavaScript code generated by different LLMs, achieving high classification accuracy even with code transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid AI-generated code proliferation necessitates reliable attribution for security and accountability. Existing methods conflate all LLMs as a single category, ignoring unique model-specific signatures.

Method: 1) Created LLM-NodeJS dataset with 50k Node.js programs from 20 LLMs (250k samples after transformations) and JSIR/AST representations. 2 Developed CodeT5-JSA: modified CodeT5 architecture with classification head for fine-grained attribution.

Result: 95.8/94.6/88.5 % accuracy for 5/10/20 class attribution. CodeT5-JSA outperforms BERT, CodeBERT, Longformer. Classifiers exploit deeper dataflow/structural patterns rather than surface features, maintaining accuracy through obfuscation.

Conclusion: LLMs leave distinct stylistic fingerprints in code structure/dataflow enabling robust attribution. Open-sourced dataset and materials demonstrate reproducibility, advancing research in code forensics and LLM accountability.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first large-scale study exploring whether
JavaScript code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can reveal which
model produced it, enabling reliable authorship attribution and model
fingerprinting. With the rapid rise of AI-generated code, attribution is
playing a critical role in detecting vulnerabilities, flagging malicious
content, and ensuring accountability. While AI-vs-human detection usually
treats AI as a single category we show that individual LLMs leave unique
stylistic signatures, even among models belonging to the same family or
parameter size. To this end, we introduce LLM-NodeJS, a dataset of 50,000
Node.js back-end programs from 20 large language models. Each has four
transformed variants, yielding 250,000 unique JavaScript samples and two
additional representations (JSIR and AST) for diverse research applications.
Using this dataset, we benchmark traditional machine learning classifiers
against fine-tuned Transformer encoders and introduce CodeT5-JSA, a custom
architecture derived from the 770M-parameter CodeT5 model with its decoder
removed and a modified classification head. It achieves 95.8% accuracy on
five-class attribution, 94.6% on ten-class, and 88.5% on twenty-class tasks,
surpassing other tested models such as BERT, CodeBERT, and Longformer. We
demonstrate that classifiers capture deeper stylistic regularities in program
dataflow and structure, rather than relying on surface-level features. As a
result, attribution remains effective even after mangling, comment removal, and
heavy code transformations. To support open science and reproducibility, we
release the LLM-NodeJS dataset, Google Colab training scripts, and all related
materials on GitHub: https://github.com/LLM-NodeJS-dataset.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Is module-lattice reduction better than unstructured lattice reduction? This
question was highlighted as 'Q8' in the Kyber NIST standardization submission
(Avanzi et al., 2021), as potentially affecting the concrete security of Kyber
and other module-lattice-based schemes. Foundational works on module-lattice
reduction (Lee, Pellet-Mary, Stehl\'e, and Wallet, ASIACRYPT 2019; Mukherjee
and Stephens-Davidowitz, CRYPTO 2020) confirmed the existence of such module
variants of LLL and block-reduction algorithms, but focus only on provable
worst-case asymptotic behavior.
  In this work, we present a concrete average-case analysis of module-lattice
reduction. Specifically, we address the question of the expected slope after
running module-BKZ, and pinpoint the discriminant $\Delta_K$ of the number
field at hand as the main quantity driving this slope. We convert this back
into a gain or loss on the blocksize $\beta$: module-BKZ in a number field $K$
of degree $d$ requires an SVP oracle of dimension $\beta + \log(|\Delta_K| /
d^d)\beta /(d\log \beta) + o(\beta / \log \beta)$ to reach the same slope as
unstructured BKZ with blocksize $\beta$. This asymptotic summary hides further
terms that we predict concretely using experimentally verified heuristics.
Incidentally, we provide the first open-source implementation of module-BKZ for
some cyclotomic fields.
  For power-of-two cyclotomic fields, we have $|\Delta_K| = d^d$, and conclude
that module-BKZ requires a blocksize larger than its unstructured counterpart
by $d-1+o(1)$. On the contrary, for all other cyclotomic fields we have
$|\Delta_K| < d^d$, so module-BKZ provides a sublinear $\Theta(\beta/\log
\beta)$ gain on the required blocksize, yielding a subexponential speedup of
$\exp(\Theta(\beta/\log \beta))$.

### [45] [Toxic Ink on Immutable Paper: Content Moderation for Ethereum Input Data Messages (IDMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10761)
*Xihan Xiong,Zhipeng Wang,Qin Wang,William Knottenbelt*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses toxic content in Ethereum's Input Data Messages (IDMs) by proposing two moderation frameworks: BUILDERMOD (builder-based semantic checks during block construction) and USERMOD (user-initiated moderation proofs in transactions). USERMOD is shown to be more scalable and practical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethereum's transaction data field is increasingly used for decentralized communication, but lacks protocol-level content moderation, enabling toxic content. Protocol-level solutions are needed to maintain safety and social responsibility in decentralized systems.

Method: Two moderation approaches were designed and evaluated: (1)...

Result: BUILDERMOD incurs high block-time overhead, while USERMOD demonstrates lower-latency validation and better scaling capabilities in moderation-aware environments.

Conclusion: USERMOD provides a viable pathway for content governance in decentralized systems, laying groundwork for safer, trustworthy, and socially responsible Ethereum communication infrastructure.

Abstract: Decentralized communication is becoming an important use case within Web3. On
Ethereum, users can repurpose the transaction input data field to embed
natural-language messages, commonly known as Input Data Messages (IDMs).
However, as IDMs gain wider adoption, there has been a growing volume of toxic
content on-chain. This trend is concerning, as Ethereum provides no
protocol-level support for content moderation.
  We propose two moderation frameworks for Ethereum IDMs: (i) BUILDERMOD, where
builders perform semantic checks during block construction; and (ii) USERMOD,
where users proactively obtain moderation proofs from external classifiers and
embed them in transactions. Our evaluation reveals that BUILDERMOD incurs high
block-time overhead, which limits its practicality. In contrast, USERMOD
enables lower-latency validation and scales more effectively, making it a more
practical approach in moderation-aware Ethereum environments.
  Our study lays the groundwork for protocol-level content governance in
decentralized systems, and we hope it contributes to the development of a
decentralized communication environment that is safe, trustworthy, and socially
responsible.

*Ahmad Mohammadi,Reza Ahmari,Vahid Hemmati,Frederick Owusu-Ambrose,Mahmoud Nabil Mahmoud,Parham Kebria,Abdollah Homaifar,Mehrdad Saif*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptive DBSCAN method for real-time GPS spoofing detection in AVs, updating threshold using sensor data and evaluating with HDD subsets for various spoofing attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing vulnerability of autonomous vehicles to GPS spoofing threats necessitates real-time, adaptive detection methods.

Method: An adaptive DBSCAN algorithm dynamically tunes the detection threshold (epsilon) using recursive mean and standard deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors, updated only during non-anomalous instances.

Result: Successful detection of multiple spoofing attack types (turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and small biased attacks) on HDD subsets with high accuracies, up to 99.960.1%.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves AV security against GPS spoofing by adapting to real-time data, showing robust performance across various attack scenarios.

Abstract: As autonomous vehicles become an essential component of modern
transportation, they are increasingly vulnerable to threats such as GPS
spoofing attacks. This study presents an adaptive detection approach utilizing
a dynamically tuned Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
(DBSCAN) algorithm, designed to adjust the detection threshold ({\epsilon}) in
real-time. The threshold is updated based on the recursive mean and standard
deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors data, but
only at instances classified as non-anomalous. Furthermore, an initial
threshold, determined from 120,000 clean data samples, ensures the capability
to identify even subtle and gradual GPS spoofing attempts from the beginning.
To assess the performance of the proposed method, five different subsets from
the real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD) are selected to
simulate both large and small magnitude GPS spoofing attacks. The modified
algorithm effectively identifies turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and multiple
small biased spoofing attacks, achieving detection accuracies of 98.621%,
99.960.1%, 99.880.1%, and 98.380.1%, respectively. This work provides a
substantial advancement in enhancing the security and safety of AVs against GPS
spoofing threats.

### [47] [A Symmetric-Key Cryptosystem Based on the Burnside Ring of a Compact Lie Group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10901)

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Classical linear ciphers, such as the Hill cipher, operate on fixed,
finite-dimensional modules and are therefore vulnerable to straightforward
known-plaintext attacks that recover the key as a fully determined linear
operator. We propose a symmetric-key cryptosystem whose linear action takes
place instead in the Burnside ring $A(G)$ of a compact Lie group $G$, with
emphasis on the case $G=O(2)$. The secret key consists of (i) a compact Lie
group $G$; (ii) a secret total ordering of the subgroup orbit-basis of $A(G)$;
and (iii) a finite set $S$ of indices of irreducible $G$-representations, whose
associated basic degrees define an involutory multiplier $k\in A(G)$. Messages
of arbitrary finite length are encoded as finitely supported elements of $A(G)$
and encrypted via the Burnside product with $k$. For $G=O(2)$ we prove that
encryption preserves plaintext support among the generators
$\{(D_1),\dots,(D_L),(SO(2)),(O(2))\}$, avoiding ciphertext expansion and
security leakage. We then analyze security in passive models, showing that any
finite set of observations constrains the action only on a finite-rank
submodule $W_L\subset A(O(2))$, and we show information-theoretic
non-identifiability of the key from such data. Finally, we prove the scheme is
\emph{not} IND-CPA secure, by presenting a one-query chosen-plaintext
distinguisher based on dihedral probes.

### [48] [TabVLA: Targeted Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10932)
*Zonghuan Xu,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces TabVLA, a framework for targeted backdoor attacks on Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models via black-box fine-tuning. It identifies the vision channel as the primary attack surface and
proposes a detection-based defense against such attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attack research on VLA models focuses on untargeted attacks, while targeted manipulation poses a
more severe real-world threat. The paper addresses this gap by studying targeted backdoor attacks and
their practical implications.

Method: TabVLA employs black-box fine-tuning with two inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene
triggering. It formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to maximize attack
effectiveness. A detection defense reconstructs latent visual triggers from input streams to identify
backdoor activations.

Result: Experiments on OpenVLA-7B with LIBERO benchmark show targeted backdoors succeed with minimal
poisoning, are robust to trigger variations, and fail only with positional mismatches. The proposed
defense achieves partial mitigation by detecting latent triggers in input streams.

Conclusion: VLA models are critically vulnerable to targeted backdoor attacks through the vision channel. The work
demonstrates practical attack efficacy and highlights the urgent need for advanced defense
techniques to secure embodied AI systems.

Abstract: With the growing deployment of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in
real-world embodied AI systems, their increasing vulnerability to backdoor
attacks poses a serious safety threat. A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly
triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions,
potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor
attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on
untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of
targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor
attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such
attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant
inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It
formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve
attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal
that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors
succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger
design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and
inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense
against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream
to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the
vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores
the need for more advanced defenses.

### [49] [DITTO: A Spoofing Attack Framework on Watermarked LLMs via Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10987)
*Hyeseon Ahn,Shinwoo Park,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces watermark spoofing, an attack that allows malicious models to mimic the watermarks of trusted models, undermining authorship verification and enabling misattribution of harmful content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The core assumption of LLM watermarking—that unique watermarks prove authorship—is fundamentally flawed, creating security risks for disinformation and content accountability. Current systems cannot detect spoofed watermarks, necessitating robust solutions.

Method: The authors exploit 'watermark radioactivity,' where fine-tuned models inherit training data patterns. By distilling knowledge from a watermarked 'teacher model,' attackers steal and replicate the watermark signal, generating plausible spoofed outputs.

Result: The attack successfully generates text with authentic-appearing watermarks from victim models, demonstrating the feasibility of misattribution. This exposes a critical vulnerability in relying on watermarks for authorship verification.

Conclusion: The work highlights the urgent need for watermarking technologies that distinguish genuine from spoofed signals. It advocates for a paradigm shift toward detection methods resilient to sophisticated imitation attacks.

Abstract: The promise of LLM watermarking rests on a core assumption that a specific
watermark proves authorship by a specific model. We demonstrate that this
assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark
spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text
containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This
enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation,
to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark
radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning,
from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a
watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and
replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a
critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm
shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from
expertly imitated ones. Our code is available at

### [50] [Secret-Protected Evolution for Differentially Private Synthetic Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10990)
*Tianze Wang,Zhaoyu Chen,Jian Du,Yingtai Xiao,Linjun Zhang,Qiang Yan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Analysis of SecPE finds FID is better than baselines with less noise and computation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality private text is not freely available, so lots of work on synthetic text generation. However, current methods put uniform guarantees on everything regardless of sensitiveness, which is not ideal.

Method: The proposed approach is SecPE, which is an evolution framework with secret-aware protection. The method is said to be a relaxation of Gaussian DP with (p, r)-secret protection, and theoretically and empirically different from baseline methods.

Result: Across three benchmarks the FID is noticeably better and downstream task accuracy is better as well with less noise then baselines.

Conclusion: Secret-aware guarantees can allow for better synthetic text generation, which is the main takeaway for the paper.

Abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and
even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text
in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns.
Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been
proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting
sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes
uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in
substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose
Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private
evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE
satisfies $(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a
relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs,
while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline
methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE
consistently achieves lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher
downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less
noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that
secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective
privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.

### [51] [Stabilizing the Staking Rate, Dynamically Distributed Inflation and Delay Induced Oscillations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11065)
*Carlo Brunetta,Amit Chaudhary,Stefano Galatolo,Massimiliano Sala*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines instability in blockchain staking rate dynamics caused by oscillation from annual percentage yield (APY)-inflation interactions, proposing a novel inflation distribution model to stabilize staking rates within target ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blockchain networks use dynamically distributed inflation to balance network security and token liquidity, but APY sensitivity to staking rate changes and delayed staker responses create harmful oscillations around equilibrium points, threatening system stability.

Method: The authors analyze inflation-based reward system dynamics through theoretical modeling and design a novel distribution mechanism that introduces dampening effects to counteract oscillations, maintaining stable staking yields within predefined target ranges.

Result: The proposed model effectively reduces oscillation amplitudes and stabilizes the staking yield, successfully maintaining the network token balance within the desired target range under simulated conditions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that strategic inflation distribution can mitigate staking rate instability, providing a framework to achieve stable equilibrium between network security and token liquidity in proof-of-stake blockchain systems.

Abstract: Dynamically distributed inflation is a common mechanism used to guide a
blockchain's staking rate towards a desired equilibrium between network
security and token liquidity.
  However, the high sensitivity of the annual percentage yield to changes in
the staking rate, coupled with the inherent feedback delays in staker
responses, can induce undesirable oscillations around this equilibrium.
  This paper investigates this instability phenomenon. We analyze the dynamics
of inflation-based reward systems and propose a novel distribution model
designed to stabilize the staking rate. Our solution effectively dampens
oscillations, stabilizing the yield within a target staking range.

*Incheol Baek,Yon Dohn Chung*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes the N-output mechanism to address the gap in LDP methods for numerical data collection, offering optimal mechanisms for arbitrary output sizes N ≥ 2 through optimization-based design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDP mechanisms are limited to small ($|\Omega| \in \{2, 3\}$) or infinite output spaces, leaving no generalized solution for arbitrary N, which hinders practical applications requiring moderate output sizes.

Method: The authors formulate mechanism design as an optimization problem to minimize estimation variance for any N ≥ 2, deriving numerical and analytical solutions that enable adaptive mechanisms. They also extend the framework to distribution estimation tasks.

Result: The N-output mechanism achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for mean, variance, and distribution estimation with low communication costs, validated through empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: The N-output mechanism fills the critical gap in LDP literature by providing a generalized, adaptive framework for arbitrary output sizes, significantly improving estimation accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) addresses significant privacy concerns in
sensitive data collection. In this work, we focus on numerical data collection
under LDP, targeting a significant gap in the literature: existing LDP
mechanisms are optimized for either a very small ($|\Omega| \in \{2, 3\}$) or
infinite output spaces. However, no generalized method for constructing an
optimal mechanism for an arbitrary output size $N$ exists. To fill this gap, we
propose the \textbf{N-output mechanism}, a generalized framework that maps
numerical data to one of $N$ discrete outputs.
  We formulate the mechanism's design as an optimization problem to minimize
estimation variance for any given $N \geq 2$ and develop both numerical and
analytical solutions. This results in a mechanism that is highly accurate and
adaptive, as its design is determined by solving an optimization problem for
any chosen $N$. Furthermore, we extend our framework and existing mechanisms to
the task of distribution estimation. Empirical evaluations show that the
N-output mechanism achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for mean, variance, and
distribution estimation with small communication costs.

*Yang Zhuochen,Fok Kar Wai,Thing Vrizlynn*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CoSPED is a new method for testing data extraction risks in large language models, achieving high extraction rates and demonstrating an effective defense strategy through rank-one model editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing concern over privacy leakage in large language models, aiming to assess data extraction risks and develop effective mitigation strategies.

Method: The method involves introducing components like Dynamic Loss, Additive Loss, Common Loss, and Self-Consistency Decoding to improve the consistency of soft prompt tuning. The defense mechanism uses Rank-One Model Editing.

Result: The proposed method achieved an extraction rate of 65.2% with a 50-token prefix and demonstrated a significant reduction to 1.6% when using the defense strategy. Cross-model comparisons were also evaluated.

Conclusion: The research shows that the analysis of extraction mechanisms using CoSPED can lead to effective defense strategies against soft prompt-based attacks, contributing to the security of large language models.

Abstract: Large language models have gained widespread attention recently, but their
potential security vulnerabilities, especially privacy leakage, are also
becoming apparent. To test and evaluate for data extraction risks in LLM, we
proposed CoSPED, short for Consistent Soft Prompt targeted data Extraction and
Defense. We introduce several innovative components, including Dynamic Loss,
Additive Loss, Common Loss, and Self Consistency Decoding Strategy, and tested
to enhance the consistency of the soft prompt tuning process. Through extensive
experimentation with various combinations, we achieved an extraction rate of
65.2% at a 50-token prefix comparison. Our comparisons of CoSPED with other
reference works confirm our superior extraction rates. We evaluate CoSPED on
more scenarios, achieving Pythia model extraction rate of 51.7% and introducing
cross-model comparison. Finally, we explore defense through Rank-One Model
Editing and achieve a reduction in the extraction rate to 1.6%, which proves
that our analysis of extraction mechanisms can directly inform effective
mitigation strategies against soft prompt-based attacks.

### [54] [RAG-Pull: Imperceptible Attacks on RAG Systems for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11195)
*Vasilije Stambolic,Aritra Dhar,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAG-Pull, a new black-box attack method that exploits vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models by inserting hidden UTF characters into queries or code repositories. This redirects the retrieval process to malicious code, compromising model safety, and introduces vulnerabilities like remote code execution and SQL injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to reduce hallucination and enhance the reliability of large language models (LLMs) necessitates an investigation into potential security risks, particularly regarding their reliance on external data sources that can be manipulated by adversarial attacks.

Method: RAG-Pull is developed as a black-box attack that introduces hidden UTF characters into either the input queries or the external code repositories used by RAG systems. These perturbations subtly alter the retrieval process to favor attacker-controlled code snippets, even without direct access to the model architecture or training data.

Result: Experiments show that RAG-Pull successfully manipulates the retrieval mechanism to return malicious code, leading to vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL injection. Combined query-and-target perturbations demonstrate a near-perfect success rate in redirecting retrieval outcomes.

Conclusion: The study reveals that RAG models are susceptible to new types of adversarial attacks through manipulation of query and external data. It underscores the need for robust security measures to safeguard RAG systems against such threats as the technology continues to evolve.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) increases the reliability and
trustworthiness of the LLM response and reduces hallucination by eliminating
the need for model retraining. It does so by adding external data into the
LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that
inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories,
redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models'
safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift
retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target
perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets
introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL
injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety
alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a
new class of attacks on LLMs.

*Jiahao Liu,Bonan Ruan,Xianglin Yang,Zhiwei Lin,Yan Liu,Yang Wang,Tao Wei,Zhenkai Liang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces TraceAegis, a security framework for LLM agents that uses execution traces to detect anomalies through hierarchical and semantic constraints, achieving strong results on the TraceAegis-Bench dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents face complex security threats like tool poisoning and malicious instructions, which existing rule-based approaches struggle to comprehensively detect due to manual labor and design limitations.

Method: TraceAegis analyzes agent execution traces to build a hierarchical structure of typical behavior units, creating constrained behavioral rules to detect anomalies.

Result: Strong performance on the TraceAegis-Bench dataset (2,600 examples) with high detection rates while maintaining low false positives.

Conclusion: TraceAegis provides an effective, scalable approach to secure agent execution by learning constraints directly from behavior traces, offering a unique advantage as agents evolve.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have demonstrated promising adaptability in real-world
applications. However, these agents remain vulnerable to a wide range of
attacks, such as tool poisoning and malicious instructions, that compromise
their execution flow and can lead to serious consequences like data breaches
and financial loss. Existing studies typically attempt to mitigate such
anomalies by predefining specific rules and enforcing them at runtime to
enhance safety. Yet, designing comprehensive rules is difficult, requiring
extensive manual effort and still leaving gaps that result in false negatives.
As agent systems evolve into complex software systems, we take inspiration from
software system security and propose TraceAegis, a provenance-based analysis
framework that leverages agent execution traces to detect potential anomalies.
In particular, TraceAegis constructs a hierarchical structure to abstract
stable execution units that characterize normal agent behaviors. These units
are then summarized into constrained behavioral rules that specify the
conditions necessary to complete a task. By validating execution traces against
both hierarchical and behavioral constraints, TraceAegis is able to effectively
detect abnormal behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of TraceAegis, we
introduce TraceAegis-Bench, a dataset covering two representative scenarios:
healthcare and corporate procurement. Each scenario includes 1,300 benign
behaviors and 300 abnormal behaviors, where the anomalies either violate the
agent's execution order or break the semantic consistency of its execution
sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that TraceAegis achieves strong
performance on TraceAegis-Bench, successfully identifying the majority of
abnormal behaviors.

### [56] [MPCitH-based Signatures from Restricted Decoding Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11224)
*Michele Battagliola,Sebastian Bitzer,Antonia Wachter-Zeh,Violetta Weger*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structurally simple modeling approach using restricted decoding within TCitH/VOLEitH frameworks to achieve significantly reduced digital signature sizes compared to existing NIST submissions, leveraging the hardness assumptions of CROSS and WAVE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MPCitH-based digital signature schemes (TCitH/VOLEitH) require performance improvements, particularly in signature size reduction for practical cryptographic applications.

Method: Embeds the restricted decoding problem into TCitH/VOLEitH frameworks by: 1) Instantiating restricted decoding with CROSS's hardness assumption; 2) Applying ternary full-weight decoding (related to WAVE's assumption) for size optimization.

Result: 1) Signature sizes reduced >50% compared to NIST submissions under CROSS assumption; 2) Achieved signature sizes comparable to the smallest MPCitH candidates in NIST competition using ternary decoding.

Conclusion: Restricted decoding offers a promising approach to optimize digital signature schemes within the MPCitH paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art size efficiency through structural simplicity and hardness assumption integration.

Abstract: Threshold-Computation-in-the-Head (TCitH) and VOLE-in-the-Head (VOLEitH), two
recent developments of the MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) paradigm, have
significantly improved the performance of digital signature schemes in this
framework.
  In this note, we embed the restricted decoding problem within these
frameworks. We propose a structurally simple modeling that achieves competitive
signature sizes. Specifically, by instantiating the restricted decoding problem
with the same hardness assumption underlying CROSS, we reduce sizes by more
than a factor of two compared to the NIST submission. Moreover, we observe that
ternary full-weight decoding, closely related to the hardness assumption
underlying WAVE, is a restricted decoding problem. Using ternary full-weight
decoding, we obtain signature sizes comparable to the smallest MPCitH-based
candidates in the NIST competition.

### [57] [Collaborative Shadows: Distributed Backdoor Attacks in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11246)
*Pengyu Zhu,Lijun Li,Yaxing Lyu,Li Sun,Sen Su,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first Distributed Backdoor Attack for LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging agent collaboration to activate a backdoor without affecting performance on benign tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on backdoor attacks in LLM-based systems has focused only on single agents, ignoring the new threat surfaces created by agent collaboration in MAS.

Method: The authors decompose a backdoor into distributed attack primitives embedded in MAS tools. These primitives become active only when agents collaborate in a specific sequence.

Result: The proposed attack achieves an attack success rate >95% on a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks, with no performance degradation on benign tasks.

Conclusion: The work highlights novel backdoor attack surfaces in MAS through agent collaboration, emphasizing the need for protection mechanisms beyond single-agent backdoors.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate increasing integration into
next-generation applications, but their safety in backdoor attacks remains
largely underexplored. However, existing research has focused exclusively on
single-agent backdoor attacks, overlooking the novel attack surfaces introduced
by agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first
Distributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into
multiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools.
These primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only
when agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full
backdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess
this threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a
sandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
attack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading
performance on benign tasks. This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces
that exploit agent collaboration, underscoring the need to move beyond
single-agent protection. Code and benchmark are available at

### [58] [Large Language Models Are Effective Code Watermarkers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11251)
*Rui Xu,Jiawei Chen,Zhaoxia Yin,Cong Kong,Xinpeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CodeMark-LLM is an LLM-driven watermarking framework that addresses limitations of existing code watermarking methods by embedding watermarks without compromising code semantics or readability, leveraging cross-lingual generalization of LLMs for scalable and robust source code attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code watermarking techniques face challenges in scalability, language generality, and robustness against attacks due to reliance on hand-crafted rules, AST manipulation, and task-specific training, while ethical concerns about unauthorized code distribution persist.

Method: The framework includes (1)a Semantically Consistent Embedding module using functionality-preserving transformations to encode watermark bits, and (2)a Differential Comparison Extraction module comparing original/watermarked code to identify transformations, relying on LLM's cross-lingual capabilities to avoid language-specific pipelines.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate robustness, effectiveness, and scalability across diverse programming languages and attack scenarios, with minimal impact on code semantics and readability.

Conclusion: CodeMark-LLM provides a generalizable, attacker-resistant solution for code watermarking by harnessing LLMs, addressing critical limitations of prior methods while maintaining practicality for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has
raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution
of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and
misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising
solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on
hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or
task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across
languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To
address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking
framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its
semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i)
Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving
transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison
Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the
original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization
ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training
pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and
attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.

### [59] [How to Get Actual Privacy and Utility from Privacy Models: the k-Anonymity and Differential Privacy Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11299)
*Josep Domingo-Ferrer,David Sánchez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines the effectiveness and limitations of major privacy models like k-anonymity and DP, finding issues with their definitions and trade-offs between privacy and utility. It suggests a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity for stronger privacy without utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the problem of ineffective privacy models for data publishing and disclosure control, which rely on theoretical guarantees but may not consistently deliver practical protection.

Method: The researchers analyze the problems in k-anonymity and differential privacy definitions, using examples to show how deterministic mechanisms in k-anonymity can allow re-identification and how DP degrades utility depending on the budget parameter.

Result: The findings show that traditional k-anonymity is susceptible to disclosure if applied without proper constraints, while DP produces significant utility loss for small budgets and offers no meaningful protection for large budgets, nullifying the benefit of theoretical privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a semantic interpretation of k-anonymity holds potential for improved privacy protection without sacrificing data utility compared to the existing methods.

Abstract: Privacy models were introduced in privacy-preserving data publishing and
statistical disclosure control with the promise to end the need for costly
empirical assessment of disclosure risk. We examine how well this promise is
kept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate
protection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur
unacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation.
Specifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with
deterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On
the other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for
small budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets.
In the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes
necessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility
preservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we
argue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust
privacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic
k-anonymity.

### [60] [TDADL-IE: A Deep Learning-Driven Cryptographic Architecture for Medical Image Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11301)
*Junhua Zhou,Quanjun Li,Weixuan Li,Guang Yu,Yihua Shao,Yihang Dong,Mengqian Wang,Zimeng Li,Changwei Gong,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes TDADL-IE, a novel image encryption system combining chaotic systems and deep learning for medical imaging security. It introduces an enhanced chaotic generator with LSTM networks and a 3D diffusion algorithm, validated for robustness against security threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital medical imaging requires stronger encryption to address vulnerabilities in existing chaotic encryption methods, which lack sufficient security for telemedicine and cloud storage applications.

Method: 1. Enhanced chaotic generator using LSTM networks with 1D-Sine Quadratic Chaotic Map (1D-SQCM). 2. Three-dimensional diffusion algorithm (TDA) for image encryption. 3. Framework compatible with images of any size.

Result: Experiments demonstrate effectiveness against security threats, with code publicly available for reproducibility. The system achieves robust encryption performance while maintaining versatility.

Conclusion: TDADL-IE provides a secure, scalable solution for medical image encryption by integrating deep learning-enhanced chaos theory, addressing critical security needs in healthcare data management.

Abstract: The rise of digital medical imaging, like MRI and CT, demands strong
encryption to protect patient data in telemedicine and cloud storage. Chaotic
systems are popular for image encryption due to their sensitivity and unique
characteristics, but existing methods often lack sufficient security. This
paper presents the Three-dimensional Diffusion Algorithm and Deep Learning
Image Encryption system (TDADL-IE), built on three key elements. First, we
propose an enhanced chaotic generator using an LSTM network with a 1D-Sine
Quadratic Chaotic Map (1D-SQCM) for better pseudorandom sequence generation.
Next, a new three-dimensional diffusion algorithm (TDA) is applied to encrypt
permuted images. TDADL-IE is versatile for images of any size. Experiments
confirm its effectiveness against various security threats. The code is

### [61] [TBRD: TESLA Authenticated UAS Broadcast Remote ID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11343)
*Jason Veara,Manav Jain,Kyle Moy,Aanjhan Ranganathan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes TBRD, a lightweight authentication system for FAA Remote ID messages to prevent spoofing and enhance drone accountability. TBRD reduces authentication overhead and computation time compared to digital signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FAA Remote ID standards lack robust authentication mechanisms, enabling spoofing, relay, and replay attacks. This threatens UAS surveillance effectiveness and future swarm mission coordination.

Method: TBRD employs the TESLA protocol for delayed key disclosure and mobile TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments). It introduces a verification mechanism optimized for computational efficiency and low communication overhead through mission-scoped authentication.

Result: TBRD achieves a 50x reduction in authentication overhead and 100x faster computation than digital signatures. Evaluations demonstrate secure message authentication in both individual and simulated 4-drone swarm scenarios under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: TBRD provides a scalable, standards-compliant solution for Remote ID authentication. It balances security with low resource demands, enabling practical integration into existing drone infrastructures for regulatory and operational purposes.

Abstract: Mysterious sightings of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) over U.S. military
facilities, suburban neighborhoods, and commercial airports have intensified
scrutiny of drone activity. To increase accountability, the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) introduced a Remote ID mandate, requiring unmanned
aircraft to broadcast their location, operator's location, and identity in
real-time. However, current standards leave authentication mechanisms
underspecified, enabling spoofing, relay, and replay attacks that can undermine
surveillance efforts and potentially disrupt UAS-to-UAS coordination in future
deployments. In this paper, we propose TBRD, a practical system for
authenticating Remote ID messages in a manner that aligns with existing
standards and UAS capabilities. TBRD leverages the TESLA protocol and mobile
device TEEs, and introduces a verification mechanism to build a lightweight,
mission-scoped authentication system that is both computationally efficient and
requires a low communication footprint. We evaluate the performance of TBRD
using both an FAA-requirements compatible proof-of-concept implementation for
performance metrics and a simulated 4-drone swarm mission scenario to
demonstrate its security guarantees under adversarial conditions. Our system
provides a 50\% reduction in authentication overhead compared to digital
signatures and a 100x reduction in computation time. Our results demonstrate
that TBRD can be integrated into current Remote ID infrastructures to provide a
scalable, standards-compliant message authentication for both regulatory and
operational use cases.

TL;DR: Future on-device LLMs may enable undetectable 'living off the land attacks'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attack mitigation strategies lack frameworks to address misuse of on-device AI capabilities

Method: Analyzes attack scenarios where threat actors integrate LLMs into attack toolchains

Result: Identifies security gaps and proposes mitigation strategies for LLM-powered attack vectors

Conclusion: Security defenses must adapt to detect LLM-based attacks while balancing AI utility in systems

Abstract: In living off the land attacks, malicious actors use legitimate tools and
processes already present on a system to avoid detection. In this paper, we
explore how the on-device LLMs of the future will become a security concern as
threat actors integrate LLMs into their living off the land attack pipeline and
ways the security community may mitigate this threat.

*Charles Fleming,Ashish Kundu,Ramana Kompella*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a TBAC model using LLM to assess risks and uncertainty, enhancing security for autonomous AI agents in enterprise environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A centralized approach is needed to address the security challenges in managing access control for novel tasks proposed by autonomous AI agents.

Method: The authors propose a novel security framework using an LLM judge that evaluates both the intent, risk of target resources and model uncertainty when making access control decisions.

Result: By considering risk and uncertainty, the model offers a more adaptive and robust security control while maintaining the principle of least privilege.

Conclusion: The framework provides a stronger security solution for autonomous systems by combining risk evaluation with uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents within enterprise environments
introduces a critical security challenge: managing access control for emergent,
novel tasks for which no predefined policies exist. This paper introduces an
advanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC)
model by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge.
This model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent
but also by explicitly considering the inherent \textbf{risk associated with
target resources} and the LLM's own \textbf{model uncertainty} in its
decision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge
synthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score
for the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or
high-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring
human approval. This dual consideration of external risk and internal
confidence allows the model to enforce a more robust and adaptive version of
the principle of least privilege, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy
autonomous systems.

### [64] [Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-based Safety Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11570)
*Shuo Chen,Zhen Han,Haokun Chen,Bailan He,Shengyun Si,Jingpei Wu,Philip Torr,Volker Tresp,Jindong Gu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper reveals that reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are severely vulnerable to input prompt manipulation. Despite initial success in defending against jailbreak attacks, these guardrails can be bypassed with simple template tokens or automated attacks, enabling harmful outputs with >90% success rates across open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety guardrails for LRMs are critical to prevent malicious misuse, but prior methods may have undetected vulnerabilities. The study addresses this gap by analyzing the robustness of reasoning-based alignment techniques against adversarial inputs.

Method: The paper (1)	analyzes the fragility of guardrails through template-token injections, (2)	introduces diverse jailbreak methods spanning white-/black-box settings, and (3)	conducts evaluations across 5 benchmarks on open-source LRM series (gpt-oss), including local and API deployments.

Result: Proposed attacks achieve >90	attack success rates against open-source LRMs with minimal computational cost. They demonstrate that even 'near-perfect'	safeguarding models like gpt-oss series can be systematically hijacked through prompt manipulation, confirming systemic vulnerabilities in current alignment techniques.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the urgent need for more robust alignment architectures for LRMs, particularly to defend against adversarial prompt engineering. Open-source models require stronger safeguards as vulnerabilities enable scalable, high-efficiency malicious usage.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs),
such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak
attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the
models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.
The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and
will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the
jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,
such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.
Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be
extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once
hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover
a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template
tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful
guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we
introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based
guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range
from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along
with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve
alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different
benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API
services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that
these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse. Code is
open-sourced at https://chenxshuo.github.io/bag-of-tricks.

*Zicheng Liu,Lige Huang,Jie Zhang,Dongrui Liu,Yuan Tian,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PACEbench, a realistic benchmark for evaluating the cyber offense capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), alongside a PACEagent to emulate human penetration testers. It highlights that current LLMs struggle with complex cyber tasks and lack the ability to bypass defenses, but the benchmark can guide future development of trustworthy models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for assessing LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities do not reflect real-world complexity, necessitating a more practical and realistic evaluation framework.

Method: The authors create PACEbench, which includes four scenarios (single, blended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations) based on real-world complexity. They also propose PACEagent, an agent that mimics human penetration testers in handling multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and exploitation. They perform extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs under the PACEbench framework.

Result: The experiments showed that current LLMs face significant challenges with complex cyber tasks and are unable to bypass the included cyber defenses. None of the tested models demonstrated the capability to perform a generalized cyber offense threat.  

Conclusion: While current LLMs are not yet a significant cyber offense threat, the introduction of PACEbench provides a robust and practical benchmark for evaluating and guiding the trustworthy development of future models, ensuring they are more dependable in cybersecurity contexts.

Abstract: The increasing autonomy of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their potential to aid in cyber offense. Existing
benchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately
assess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce
PACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles
of realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber
defenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,
blended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these
complex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human
penetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and
exploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that
current models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass
defenses. These findings suggest that current models do not yet pose a
generalized cyber offense threat. Nonetheless, our work provides a robust
benchmark to guide the trustworthy development of future models.

TL;DR: This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of the integration of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering, examining both solution paradigms and benchmarking practices to connect evaluation methods with approaches for advancing the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field needs a clearer understanding of how benchmarks and solutions for LLMs in software engineering interconnect to enable systematic progress and evaluation.

Method: The study analyzed 150+ recent papers and organized them into a taxonomy covering solution paradigms (prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, agent-based) and benchmark categories (code generation, translation, repair, etc.), synthesizing insights about the evolution and current state of LLM-based systems in software engineering.

Result: The survey revealed an evolution from prompt engineering to complex agentic systems; provides a unified pipeline for software engineering tasks; and connects over 50 benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies.

Conclusion: The work offers full-spectrum coverage of LLM-empowered software engineering, identifies research gaps, and proposes future directions such as multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving systems, and integrating formal verification.

Abstract: The integration of LLMs into software engineering has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from traditional rule-based systems to sophisticated agentic systems
capable of autonomous problem-solving. Despite this transformation, the field
lacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions
interconnect, hindering systematic progress and evaluation. This survey
presents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering,
bridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We
analyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy
spanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based,
fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code
generation, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the
field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems
incorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory
mechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that
illustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final
deliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying
complexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys
that focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting
50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling
researchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria.
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future
directions, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code
generation systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based
methods. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and
practitioners seeking to understand, evaluate, and advance LLM-empowered
software engineering systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces InteractScience, the first benchmark to measure the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to combine scientific knowledge with interactive front-end coding across five domains. It uses a hybrid testing framework to assess both code functionality and rendering accuracy, revealing LLMs' current limitations in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the growing capability of LLMs to generate complete applications from natural language instructions, particularly in science and education where interactive demonstrations are valuable. They aim to evaluate the models' ability to integrate accurate scientific knowledge with functional, user-interactive front-end code, which goes beyond existing benchmarks.

Method: They design a hybrid framework combining programmatic functional testing to verify interaction logic and visually-grounded qualitative testing to compare rendered outputs with reference snapshots. The framework underpins the InteractScience benchmark, which features questions across five scientific domains, along with unit tests, reference snapshots, and checklists for evaluation.

Result: Evaluating 30 leading LLMs (open- and closed-source) using InteractScience, the results reveal current weaknesses in models' ability to sustain an integrated application of domain knowledge and implementation of interactive behaviors in code, highlighting the challenges in generating interactive scientific demonstrations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by establishing InteractScience as a foundational resource for advancing the reliability and educational utility of LLM-generated scientific demonstration code, offering a first-of-its-kind automated evaluation of combined scientific knowledge and interactive coding capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating complete
applications from natural language instructions, creating new opportunities in
science and education. In these domains, interactive scientific demonstrations
are particularly valuable for explaining concepts, supporting new teaching
methods, and presenting research findings. Generating such demonstrations
requires models to combine accurate scientific knowledge with the ability to
implement interactive front-end code that behaves correctly and responds to
user actions. This capability goes beyond the scope of existing benchmarks,
which typically evaluate either knowledge question answering without grounding
in code or static web code generation without scientific interactivity. To
evaluate this integrated ability, we design a hybrid framework that combines
programmatic functional testing to rigorously verify interaction logic with
visually-grounded qualitative testing to assess rendered outputs against
reference snapshots. Building on this framework, we present InteractScience, a
benchmark consisting of a substantial set of carefully designed questions
across five scientific domains, each paired with unit tests, reference
snapshots, and checklists. We evaluate 30 leading open- and closed-source LLMs
and report results that highlight ongoing weaknesses in integrating domain
knowledge with interactive front-end coding. Our work positions InteractScience
as the first benchmark to automatically measure this combined capability with
realistic interactive operations, providing a foundation for advancing reliable
and educationally useful scientific demonstration code generation. All code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/open-compass/InteractScience.

### [68] [Agentic Property-Based Testing: Finding Bugs Across the Python Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09907)
*Muhammad Maaz,Liam DeVoe,Zac Hatfield-Dodds,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an LLM-based agent for autonomously testing Python code using property-based testing (PBT), achieving a high validation rate for generated bug reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the efficiency of property-based testing by automating the generation and validation of bug reports using LLMs, as traditional PBT requires manual specification of properties and test functions.

Method: The authors developed an LLM-based agent that analyzes modules, infers properties from code and documentation, synthesizes and executes PBTs, and then reflects on the outputs to generate bug reports and patches.

Result: The agent found and validated bugs in 100 Python packages; 56% of generated reports were valid bugs, and among the top 21 ranked bugs, 86% were valid. 81% of top-scoring bugs were reportable, and 3 patches were merged.

Conclusion: LLM-augmented PBT enhances test coverage by inferring properties and autonomously testing code, efficiently identifying true bugs and valid patches, thus offering a scalable testing solution.

Abstract: Property-based testing (PBT) is a lightweight formal method, typically
implemented as a randomized testing framework. Users specify the input domain
for their test using combinators supplied by the PBT framework, and the
expected properties or invariants as a unit-test function. The framework then
searches for a counterexample, e.g. by generating inputs and calling the test
function. In this work, we demonstrate an LLM-based agent which analyzes Python
modules, infers function-specific and cross-function properties from code and
documentation, synthesizes and executes PBTs, reflects on outputs of these
tests to confirm true bugs, and finally outputs actionable bug reports for the
developer. We perform an extensive evaluation of our agent across 100 popular
Python packages. Of the bug reports generated by the agent, we found after
manual review that 56\% were valid bugs and 32\% were valid bugs that we would
report to maintainers. We then developed a ranking rubric to surface
high-priority valid bugs to developers, and found that of the 21 top-scoring
bugs, 86\% were valid and 81\% we would report. The bugs span diverse failure
modes from serialization failures to numerical precision errors to flawed cache
implementations. We reported 5 bugs, 4 with patches, including to NumPy and
cloud computing SDKs, with 3 patches merged successfully. Our results suggest
that LLMs with PBT provides a rigorous and scalable method for autonomously
testing software. Our code and artifacts are available at:

### [69] [OFP-Repair: Repairing Floating-point Errors via Original-Precision Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09938)
*Youshuai Tan,Zishuo Ding,Jinfu Chen,Weiyi Shang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces OFP-Repair, a method for addressing floating-point errors in critical systems by distinguishing between original-precision-repairable errors and high-precision errors, achieving significant improvements in accuracy metrics and real-world bug fixes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating-point errors in critical domains (e.g., aerospace, finance) pose severe risks. Existing repair tools either rely on resource-heavy high-precision implementations or only handle limited error types, creating a need for efficient differentiation between error categories.

Method: OFP-Repair combines original-precision analysis with sparse high-precision computation. It identifies repairable errors using ACESO’s dataset and applies localized fixes. The method is validated through real-world case studies, including GNU Scientific Library bugs.

Result: On ACESO’s dataset, OFP-Repair improves accuracy metrics by 3–8 orders of magnitude. It fixes 5/15 bugs in a decade-old GSL report and detects all five original-precision-repairable errors in real-world cases, outperforming ACESO’s single repair success.

Conclusion: OFP-Repair demonstrates practical applicability by effectively differentiating error types and achieving superior repair performance. Its integration into industry workflows is being explored, with promising results for critical system reliability.

Abstract: Errors in floating-point programs can lead to severe consequences,
particularly in critical domains such as military, aerospace, and financial
systems, making their repair a crucial research problem. In practice, some
errors can be fixed using original-precision arithmetic, while others require
high-precision computation. Developers often avoid addressing the latter due to
excessive computational resources required. However, they sometimes struggle to
distinguish between these two types of errors, and existing repair tools fail
to assist in this differentiation. Most current repair tools rely on
high-precision implementations, which are time-consuming to develop and demand
specialized expertise. Although a few tools do not require high-precision
programs, they can only fix a limited subset of errors or produce suboptimal
results.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, named OFP-Repair.On
ACESO's dataset, our patches achieve improvements of three, seven, three, and
eight orders of magnitude across four accuracy metrics. In real-world cases,
our method successfully detects all five original-precision-repairable errors
and fixes three, whereas ACESO only repairs one. Notably, these results are
based on verified data and do not fully capture the potential of OFP-Repair. To
further validate our method, we deploy it on a decade-old open bug report from
GNU Scientific Library (GSL), successfully repairing five out of 15 bugs. The
developers have expressed interest in our method and are considering
integrating our tool into their development workflow. We are currently working
on applying our patches to GSL. The results are highly encouraging,
demonstrating the practical applicability of our technique.

### [70] [Operationalizing AI: Empirical Evidence on MLOps Practices, User Satisfaction, and Organizational Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09968)
*Stefan Pasch*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines how Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices impact user satisfaction in AI development through an analysis of 8,000 G2.com reviews, finding seven key practices correlate positively with satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizational challenges in scaling AI (e.g., maintenance, coordination) remain poorly understood empirically, particularly how MLOps practices address them.

Method: Zero-shot classification of review sentiment across nine MLOps practices (e.g., CI/CD, collaboration) using G2.com data, analyzing correlations with user satisfaction and firm size.

Result: Seven MLOps practices showed significant positive relationships with satisfaction; small firms mentioned practices less but firm size did not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link.

Conclusion: Effective MLOps implementation universally boosts AI development satisfaction, though organizational context influences how practices are adopted and discussed.

Abstract: Organizational efforts to utilize and operationalize artificial intelligence
(AI) are often accompanied by substantial challenges, including scalability,
maintenance, and coordination across teams. In response, the concept of Machine
Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that
integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing
the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices
support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains
limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI
development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure
review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous
integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility,
versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a
significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that
effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development.
However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms
discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational
context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does
not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link. This indicates that once applied,
MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational
settings.

### [71] [SLEAN: Simple Lightweight Ensemble Analysis Network for Multi-Provider LLM Coordination: Design, Implementation, and Vibe Coding Bug Investigation Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10010)
*Matheus J. T. Vargas*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SLEAN is a provider-agnostic framework for coordinating multiple LLM providers through text-based orchestration, utilizing a three-phase protocol to filter harmful AI-generated code suggestions during debugging, while maintaining minimal implementation complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of AI-assisted debugging has led to code modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing functionalities, or address non-existent problems, necessitating a reliable and mechanism for filtering harmful suggestions from multiple provider LLMs without specialized infrastructure.

Method: SLEAN employs a three-phase protocol (independent analysis, cross-critique, arbitration) on .txt templates as a simple prompt bridge between LLMs, enabling coordination without requiring modifications to LLM provider infrastructures or deep technical know-how.

Result: In testing on 15 software bugs and 69 AI-generated fixes, SLEAN accepted 22 fixes (31.9%) and rejected 47 harmful ones. Arbitration reduced code changes by 83-90%, and minimal Type 2 inputs showed a 20% efficiency gain over more detailed Type 1 inputs in achieving acceptance.

Conclusion: SLEAN's file-driven, provider-agnostic design allows for easy deployment and reliable synthesis of multiple LLM providers across various domains. It highlights the limitations of AI consensus and suggests that while high convergence is rare and barely improves reliability, arbitration mechanisms can play a role in specific low-convergence scenarios.

Abstract: We present SLEAN (Simple Lightweight Ensemble Analysis Network), a
deterministic framework for coordinating multiple LLM providers through
text-based prompt orchestration. Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring
specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between
LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for
deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis,
cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions
before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly
produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing
functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69
AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95%
CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied
verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90%
relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding
modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1
inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus
28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems
showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%)
occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points;
arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although
low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven,
provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding
expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document
verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis
with end-to-end auditability.

*Shan Jiang,Chenguang Zhu,Sarfraz Khurshid*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces OBsmith, a framework using LLMs to test JavaScript obfuscators for correctness issues, uncovering 11 new bugs not found by existing fuzzers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JavaScript obfuscators are crucial for protecting code but often lack rigorous testing for correctness, leading to potential silent functional changes.

Method: OBsmith uses large language models to generate program sketches and also extracts them from real-world code, combining both approaches for comprehensive testing. It applies these sketches to test obfuscators under different configurations.

Result: OBsmith identified 11 new correctness bugs in JavaScript obfuscators. Existing fuzzers failed to find these under the same program budget. The ablation study showed that most components are vital for uncovering different bug types.

Conclusion: OBsmith demonstrates effective testing of obfuscators, emphasizing semantic preservation. It highlights the need for obfuscator-specific testing methods and opens discussions on performance vs. obfuscation trade-offs.

Abstract: JavaScript obfuscators are widely deployed to protect intellectual property
and resist reverse engineering, yet their correctness has been largely
overlooked compared to performance and resilience. Existing evaluations
typically measure resistance to deobfuscation, leaving the critical question of
whether obfuscators preserve program semantics unanswered. Incorrect
transformations can silently alter functionality, compromise reliability, and
erode security-undermining the very purpose of obfuscation. To address this
gap, we present OBsmith, a novel framework to systematically test JavaScript
obfuscators using large language models (LLMs). OBsmith leverages LLMs to
generate program sketches abstract templates capturing diverse language
constructs, idioms, and corner cases-which are instantiated into executable
programs and subjected to obfuscation under different configurations. Besides
LLM-powered sketching, OBsmith also employs a second source: automatic
extraction of sketches from real programs. This extraction path enables more
focused testing of project specific features and lets developers inject domain
knowledge into the resulting test cases. OBsmith uncovers 11 previously unknown
correctness bugs. Under an equal program budget, five general purpose
state-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers (FuzzJIT, Jsfunfuzz, Superion, DIE,
Fuzzilli) failed to detect these issues, highlighting OBsmith's complementary
focus on obfuscation induced misbehavior. An ablation shows that all components
except our generic MRs contribute to at least one bug class; the negative MR
result suggests the need for obfuscator-specific metamorphic relations. Our
results also seed discussion on how to balance obfuscation presets and
performance cost. We envision OBsmith as an important step towards automated
testing and quality assurance of obfuscators and other semantic-preserving
toolchains.

### [73] [A Mathematics-Guided Approach to Floating-Point Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10081)
*Youshuai Tan,Zhanwei Zhang,Zishuo Ding,Lianyu Zheng,Jinfu Chen,Weiyi Shang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces MGDE, a novel method for detecting hard-to-find, error-inducing inputs in floating-point programs. It leverages the Newton-Raphson method for a quadratic convergence advantage and performs efficiently. MGDE outperforms the state-of-the-art FPCC method in terms of both bug detection rate and speed, achieving superior results in single-input and multi-input programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the critical implications of floating-point program errors, particularly in key areas like military applications, where only a few inputs can cause substantial problems. Current identification methods for these inputs are computationally heavy and inefficient in search, akin to a 'needle in a haystack' problem, underscoring the need for a more effective and less resource-intensive solution.

Method: The method, MGDE, is a newly proposed approach that harnesses the mathematical properties of the Newton-Raphson method. This choice empowers the method with quadratic convergence, enabling it to effectively and efficiently zero in on error-inducing inputs within seemingly infinite possibilities.

Result: The results demonstrate superior performance of MGDE over FPCC in both single-input and multi-input scenarios. MGDE identifies more than double the number of bugs at a significantly reduced time, with single-input programs seeing a 0.1529 times duration and multi-input programs spotlighting an average detection time of 0.6443 seconds versus FPCC's 100 seconds per program and its complete failure to detect bugs in the multi-input case.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by showcasing the efficacy and efficiency of MGDE in simultaneously resolving two critical issues in current methods for detecting floating-point program errors. These findings indicate its potential for broader adoption and future enhancement in this field.

Abstract: Floating-point program errors can lead to severe consequences, particularly
in critical domains such as military applications. Only a small subset of
inputs may induce substantial floating-point errors, prompting researchers to
develop methods for identifying these error-inducing inputs. Although existing
approaches have achieved some success, they still suffer from two major
limitations: (1) High computational cost: The evaluation of error magnitude for
candidate inputs relies on high-precision programs, which are prohibitively
time-consuming. (2) Limited long-range convergence capability: Current methods
exhibit inefficiency in search, making the process akin to finding a needle in
a haystack.
  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel method, named MGDE, to
detect error-inducing inputs based on mathematical guidance. By employing the
Newton-Raphson method, which exhibits quadratic convergence properties, we
achieve highly effective and efficient results. Since the goal of identifying
error-inducing inputs is to uncover the underlying bugs, we use the number of
bugs detected in floating-point programs as the primary evaluation metric in
our experiments. As FPCC represents the most effective state-of-the-art
approach to date, we use it as the baseline for comparison. The dataset of FPCC
consists of 88 single-input floating-point programs. FPCC is able to detect 48
bugs across 29 programs, whereas our method successfully identifies 89 bugs
across 44 programs. Moreover, FPCC takes 6.4096 times as long as our proposed
method. We also deploy our method to multi-input programs, identifying a total
of nine bugs with an average detection time of 0.6443 seconds per program. In
contrast, FPCC fails to detect any bugs while requiring an average computation
time of 100 seconds per program.

### [74] [IntrinTrans: LLM-based Intrinsic Code Translator for RISC-V Vector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10119)
*Liutong Han,Zhiyuan Tan,Hongbin Zhang,Pengcheng Wang,Chu Kang,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces IntrinTrans, an LLM-based multi-agent approach for automatically translating and optimizing intrinsic code across architectures (specifically from Arm Neon to RISC-V Vector), leveraging compile-and-test feedback and liveness analysis. Experiments on 34 algorithms show competitive correctness and performance improvements with up to a 5.93x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of RISC-V Vector's popularity, translating vectorized algorithms implemented on Arm/ x86 intrinsics to their RISC-V counterparts is becoming more practical. But manually rewriting or using rule-based approaches is time-consuming and often leads to suboptimal performance. A better method that can efficiently translate and optimize is needed.

Method: The key idea of IntrinTrans is to use large language models (LLMs) as part of a multi-agent feedback loop. Each agent forms a hypothesis, generates code, compiles it, runs tests and provides the output back into the agent network for correction and improvement. Moreover, the approach leverages liveness analysis to optimize the generated RVV intrinsics by making better use of the register resources. This loop integrates code generation with transformation, making it more efficient and higher in quality than existing rule- or manual-based alternatives.

Result: IntrinTrans shows promising results in translating and optimizing intrinsic code from Arm Neon to RISC-V Vector. Using advanced LLMs, it generates semantically correct RVV intrinsics in the majority of cases within just a few iterations. Specifically, the paper notes that in some cases the performance was improved by up to 5.93 times over community-driven baseline implementations, showing the potential of LLMs for code translation and optimization.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LLMs, through a multi-agent approach and with feedback provided by testing and compilation, can effectively cross-translate intrinsic functions while achieving substantial performance gains in some instances. This demonstrates how LLMs can be leveraged for the automatic and high-performance adaptation of intrinsics for emerging architectures like the RISC-V Vector extension.

Abstract: The use of intrinsic functions to exploit hardware-specific capabilities is
an important approach for optimizing library performance. Many mainstream
libraries implement a large number of vectorized algorithms on Arm or x86 SIMD
intrinsic functions. With the rapid expansion of the RISC-V hardware-software
ecosystem, there is a growing demand for support of the RISC-V Vector (RVV)
extension. Translating existing vectorized intrinsic code onto RVV intrinsics
is a practical and effective approach. However, current cross-architecture
translation largely relies on manual rewriting, which is time-consuming and
error-prone. Furthermore, while some rule-based methods can reduce the need for
manual intervention, their translation success rate is limited by incomplete
rule coverage and syntactic constraints, and the performance suffers from
inadequate utilization of RVV-specific features. We present IntrinTrans, a
LLM-based multi-agent approach that utilizes compile-and-test feedback to
translate intrinsic code across architectures automatically, and further
optimizes the generated RVV intrinsics using register-usage information derived
from liveness analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we
collected 34 vectorized algorithm cases from open-source libraries. Each case
includes an Arm Neon intrinsics implementation and a RVV intrinsics
implementation contributed by the open-source community, together with
correctness and performance tests. Our experiments show that advanced LLMs
produce semantically correct RISC-V Vector intrinsics in most cases within a
limited number of iterations, and in some cases achieve up to 5.93x the
performance of the native implementation from the open-source community.

### [75] [A Systematic Study on Generating Web Vulnerability Proof-of-Concepts Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10148)
*Mengyao Zhao,Kaixuan Li,Lyuye Zhang,Wenjing Dang,Chenggong Ding,Sen Chen,Zheli Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs, GPT-4o/DeepSeek-R1) to automatically generate Proof-of-Concept (PoC exploits for web vulnerabilities using publicly disclosed information. They achieve 8-72success rates depending on contextual data availability and adaptive reasoning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing capability of LLMs in code tasks raises security concerns. Existing research focuses on zero-day exploits, but this paper investigates whether LLMs can leverage publicly available CVE information (descriptions, patches, code) to generate PoCs efficiently and at scale.

Method: Empirical evaluation of GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on 100 real CVEs across three disclosure stages: (1)newly disclosed (descriptions only), (2p1-day (patches available), (3)pN-day (full code context). Tests include function/file-level code context and adaptive reasoning prompt strategies.

Result: LLMs generated valid PoCs in 8-34with public data alone, rising to 6872 with adaptive reasoning. DeepSeek-R1 outperformed GPT-4o consistently. Code context improved success rates by 17-20(function-level context provided 9-13 improvement over file-level. 23 new PoCs were accepted by NVD/Exploit DB.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly reshape vulnerability exploitation dynamics by enabling automated PoC generation using public information. Their effectiveness increases with contextual data quality and adaptive reasoning strategies, highlighting both security risks and mitigation opportunities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought remarkable
progress in code understanding and reasoning, creating new opportunities and
raising new concerns for software security. Among many downstream tasks,
generating Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits plays a central role in
vulnerability reproduction, comprehension, and mitigation. While previous
research has focused primarily on zero-day exploitation, the growing
availability of rich public information accompanying disclosed CVEs leads to a
natural question: can LLMs effectively use this information to automatically
generate valid PoCs? In this paper, we present the first empirical study of
LLM-based PoC generation for web application vulnerabilities, focusing on the
practical feasibility of leveraging publicly disclosed information. We evaluate
GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on 100 real-world and reproducible CVEs across three
stages of vulnerability disclosure: (1) newly disclosed vulnerabilities with
only descriptions, (2) 1-day vulnerabilities with patches, and (3) N-day
vulnerabilities with full contextual code. Our results show that LLMs can
automatically generate working PoCs in 8%-34% of cases using only public data,
with DeepSeek-R1 consistently outperforming GPT-4o. Further analysis shows that
supplementing code context improves success rates by 17%-20%, with
function-level providing 9%-13% improvement than file-level ones. Further
integrating adaptive reasoning strategies to prompt refinement significantly
improves success rates to 68%-72%. Our findings suggest that LLMs could reshape
vulnerability exploitation dynamics. To date, 23 newly generated PoCs have been
accepted by NVD and Exploit DB.

*Linghan Huang,Peizhou Zhao,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MOJOFuzzer is introduced as the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework for emerging programming languages, particularly MOJO, to enhance test validity and bug detection by systematically eliminating low-quality inputs and dynamically adapting prompts based on runtime feedback, uncovering 13 new bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid development of LLMs has transformed fuzz testing by automating input generation, but MOJO, a new high-performance language, lacks testing frameworks and corpus, leading to model hallucination and reduced test effectiveness due to semantically incorrect code.

Method: MOJOFuzzer integrates a multi-phase framework to filter out low-quality generated inputs before execution and uses runtime feedback to dynamically adapt LLM prompts for test case mutation, facilitating iterative learning in a zero-shot setting.

Result: MOJOFuzzer significantly improves test validity, API coverage, and bug detection, outperforming traditional fuzz testing and existing LLM-based methods, with the identification of 13 new bugs in MOJO.

Conclusion: MOJOFuzzer advances LLM-driven software testing by providing an effective framework for emerging languages, establishing a foundational methodology to enhance testing through adaptive prompt techniques and input filtering, and successfully uncovering bugs in MOJO.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
software testing, particularly fuzz testing, by automating the generation of
diverse and effective test inputs. This advancement holds great promise for
improving software reliability. Meanwhile, the introduction of MOJO, a
high-performance AI programming language blending Python's usability with the
efficiency of C and C++, presents new opportunities to enhance AI model
scalability and programmability. However, as a new language, MOJO lacks
comprehensive testing frameworks and a sufficient corpus for LLM-based testing,
which exacerbates model hallucination. In this case, LLMs will generate
syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code, significantly reducing the
effectiveness of fuzz testing. To address this challenge, we propose
MOJOFuzzer, the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework designed for
zero-shot learning environments of emerging programming languages. MOJOFuzzer
integrates a mutil-phase framework that systematically eliminates low-quality
generated inputs before execution, significantly improving test case validity.
Furthermore, MOJOFuzzer dynamically adapts LLM prompts based on runtime
feedback for test case mutation, enabling an iterative learning process that
continuously enhances fuzzing efficiency and bug detection performance. Our
experimental results demonstrate that MOJOFuzzer significantly enhances test
validity, API coverage, and bug detection performance, outperforming
traditional fuzz testing and state-of-the-art LLM-based fuzzing approaches.
Using MOJOFuzzer, we have conducted a first large-scale fuzz testing evaluation
of MOJO, uncorvering 13 previous unknown bugs. This study not only advances the
field of LLM-driven software testing but also establishes a foundational
methodology for leveraging LLMs in the testing of emerging programming
languages.

*Sayan Mandal,Hua Jiang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A production system for efficient, grounded code review in compliance settings combines AST-guided context extraction with a lightweight serving stack (quantized open-weight model + multi-tier caching), achieving sub-minute feedback and competitive violation reduction while mitigating LLM hallucination risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compliance-critical environments struggle with static analyzers' alert overload and LLMs', requiring rationalized, efficient feedback. Proprietary LLMs introduce costs and unreliability.

Method: AST-based context extraction pairs with a single-GPU, on-demand serving system (quantized open-weight model, multi-tier caching). Decoupled architecture supports modular adoption: teams can implement grounding/prompting or serving layers independently.

Result: Sub-60s median first-feedback time (C/C++ safety standards), 23% lower violation rates than larger proprietary models, and 58%-74% reduction in manual triage effort per survey (n=8). Maintained competitive violation reduction while reducing human review iterations.

Conclusion: Demonstrated scalable, auditable code review architecture balancing speed, explanation quality, and compliance rigor. Operational lessons highlight modularity, reproducibility, and pathways for assisted patching, while limitations acknowledge survey scale and domain specificity constraints.

Abstract: Automated code review adoption lags in compliance-heavy settings, where
static analyzers produce high-volume, low-rationale outputs, and naive LLM use
risks hallucination and incurring cost overhead. We present a production system
for grounded, PR-native review that pairs static-analysis findings with
AST-guided context extraction and a single-GPU, on-demand serving stack
(quantized open-weight model, multi-tier caching) to deliver concise
explanations and remediation guidance. Evaluated on safety-oriented C/C++
standards, the approach achieves sub-minute median first-feedback (offline p50
build+LLM 59.8s) while maintaining competitive violation reduction and lower
violation rates versus larger proprietary models. The architecture is
decoupled: teams can adopt the grounding/prompting layer or the serving layer
independently. A small internal survey (n=8) provides directional signals of
reduced triage effort and moderate perceived grounding, with participants
reporting fewer human review iterations. We outline operational lessons and
limitations, emphasizing reproducibility, auditability, and pathways to broader
standards and assisted patching.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper compares drift-based retraining (triggered by data changes) with periodic retraining for capacity forecasting models, finding drift-based retraining to be cost-effective with comparable accuracy in most cases, though periodic retraining is better for rapidly evolving data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuously retraining forecasting models for capacity management is costly and difficult to scale, but infrequent retraining risks reduced accuracy. Software teams need strategies to balance efficiency and performance in dynamic data environments.

Method: The paper experimentally evaluates the accuracy and cost of two retraining approaches — drift-based (retraining upon detecting data changes) and periodic (fixed-interval retraining) — using time series forecasting models.

Result: Drift-based retraining achieves comparable accuracy to periodic retraining in most scenarios while reducing computational costs. However, for rapidly changing data, periodic retraining remains necessary to maintain maximum accuracy.

Conclusion: Drift-based retraining offers a practical, cost-effective solution for capacity forecasting when data evolves slowly to moderately, but periodic retraining is still recommended for environments with fast-moving data patterns.

Abstract: Capacity management is critical for software organizations to allocate
resources effectively and meet operational demands. An important step in
capacity management is predicting future resource needs often relies on
data-driven analytics and machine learning (ML) forecasting models, which
require frequent retraining to stay relevant as data evolves. Continuously
retraining the forecasting models can be expensive and difficult to scale,
posing a challenge for engineering teams tasked with balancing accuracy and
efficiency. Retraining only when the data changes appears to be a more
computationally efficient alternative, but its impact on accuracy requires
further investigation. In this work, we investigate the effects of retraining
capacity forecasting models for time series based on detected changes in the
data compared to periodic retraining. Our results show that drift-based
retraining achieves comparable forecasting accuracy to periodic retraining in
most cases, making it a cost-effective strategy. However, in cases where data
is changing rapidly, periodic retraining is still preferred to maximize the
forecasting accuracy. These findings offer actionable insights for software
teams to enhance forecasting systems, reducing retraining overhead while
maintaining robust performance.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities remain a persistent risk, yet static and dynamic
analyses often overlook structural dependencies that shape insecure behaviors.
Viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs, we capture control- and data-flow
relations as complex interaction networks. Our hybrid framework combines these
graph representations with light-weight (<4B) local LLMs, uniting topological
features with semantic reasoning while avoiding the cost and privacy concerns
of large cloud models. Evaluated on Java vulnerability detection (binary
classification), our method achieves 93.57% accuracy-an 8.36% gain over Graph
Attention Network-based embeddings and 17.81% over pretrained LLM baselines
such as Qwen2.5 Coder 3B. Beyond accuracy, the approach extracts salient
subgraphs and generates natural language explanations, improving
interpretability for developers. These results pave the way for scalable,
explainable, and locally deployable tools that can shift vulnerability analysis
from purely syntactic checks to deeper structural and semantic insights,
facilitating broader adoption in real-world secure software development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper is the first comprehensive study to examine the robustness of multi-agent systems (MASs) for code generation using a fuzzing-based testing approach, revealing significant robustness flaws. The authors identify miscommunications between planning and coding agents as a common yet overlooked cause and propose a repairing method with multi-prompt generation and a new monitor agent, which improves the robustness of MASs, addressing the need for more reliable code generation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems (MASs) for code generation are gaining traction due to their impressive performance on coding tasks. However, under-explored robustness raises concerns for their real-world use. There is a need to understand and mitigate their robustness flaws to ensure reliable deployment.

Method: The paper evaluates the robustness of MASs using a fuzzing-based testing approach. It involves a fuzzing pipeline that applies semantic-preserving mutation operators along with a novel fitness function to test mainstream MASs across various datasets and LLMs. The method also includes a repairing strategy based on multi-prompt generation and introducing a monitor agent to address system flaws.

Result: MASs for code generation were found to fail solving 7.9-83.3% of initially successful problems after applying semantic-preserving mutations. The repairing method successfully resolved 40-88.9% of these failures, demonstrating effectiveness in improving robustness.

Conclusion: The study uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs for code generation, primarily due to miscommunications between planning and coding agents during detailed code implementation. The proposed repairing method significantly mitigates these flaws, offering essential insights for building more reliable systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for automated
code generation, demonstrating impressive performance on established benchmarks
by decomposing complex coding tasks across specialized agents with different
roles. Despite their prosperous development and adoption, their robustness
remains pressingly under-explored, raising critical concerns for real-world
deployment. This paper presents the first comprehensive study examining the
robustness of MASs for code generation through a fuzzing-based testing
approach. By designing a fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving
mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs
across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness
flaws of various popular MASs: they fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they
initially resolved successfully after applying the semantic-preserving
mutations. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we identify a common yet
largely overlooked cause of the robustness issue: miscommunications between
planning and coding agents, where plans lack sufficient detail and coding
agents misinterpret intricate logic, aligning with the challenges inherent in a
multi-stage information transformation process. Accordingly, we also propose a
repairing method that encompasses multi-prompt generation and introduces a new
monitor agent to address this issue. Evaluation shows that our repairing method
effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0%-88.9% of
identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and
provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for
developing more reliable MASs for code generation.

### [81] [How Students Use Generative AI for Software Testing: An Observational Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10551)
*Baris Ardic,Quentin Le Dilavrec,Andy Zaidman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines the interaction strategies and experiences of novice software developers using generative AI tools like ChatGPT for unit test engineering. Findings indicate both benefits and challenges in AI-assisted workflows without substantial impact on test effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The introduction of generative AI into software engineering poses questions about its impact on novice developers' productivity, control, output quality, and learning in the context of unit test engineering.

Method: An observational study with 12 undergraduate students working with generative AI to create unit tests where the researchers identified interaction strategies, prompting styles, and solicited feedback on benefits and challenges.

Result: Four interaction strategies were identified based on the origin of test ideas and implementations. Two prompting styles (one-shot and iterative) emerged and were associated with these strategies. Perceived benefits included time-saving and reduced cognitive load, while challenges involved trust, quality issues, and ownership concerns. Quantitatively, strategies did not significantly impact test effectiveness or code quality.

Conclusion: Generative AI influences how novices approach unit test engineering through distinct interaction and prompting styles. Despite benefits, concerns such as trust and ownership persist, and the study found no significant differences in test effectiveness or code quality related to the use of AI.

Abstract: The integration of generative AI tools like ChatGPT into software engineering
workflows opens up new opportunities to boost productivity in tasks such as
unit test engineering. However, these AI-assisted workflows can also
significantly alter the developer's role, raising concerns about control,
output quality, and learning, particularly for novice developers. This study
investigates how novice software developers with foundational knowledge in
software testing interact with generative AI for engineering unit tests. Our
goal is to examine the strategies they use, how heavily they rely on generative
AI, and the benefits and challenges they perceive when using generative
AI-assisted approaches for test engineering. We conducted an observational
study involving 12 undergraduate students who worked with generative AI for
unit testing tasks. We identified four interaction strategies, defined by
whether the test idea or the test implementation originated from generative AI
or the participant. Additionally, we singled out prompting styles that focused
on one-shot or iterative test generation, which often aligned with the broader
interaction strategy. Students reported benefits including time-saving, reduced
cognitive load, and support for test ideation, but also noted drawbacks such as
diminished trust, test quality concerns, and lack of ownership. While strategy
and prompting styles influenced workflow dynamics, they did not significantly
affect test effectiveness or test code quality as measured by mutation score or
test smells.

### [82] [Generative AI and the Transformation of Software Development Practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10819)
*Vivek Acharya*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines how generative AI (e.g., LLMs)L is transforming software engineering through new practices like chat-based coding and agentic programming, highlighting opportunities (democratized development) and challenges (reliability, cost).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the impact of AI on software development workflows, address trust/ accountability concerns, and identify necessary skill shifts as AI becomes integral to coding workflows. It seeks to balance excitement for productivity gains with critical technical and educational challenges.

Method: The analysis combines literature review of iterative chat-based development and multi-agent systems, experimental analysis of dynamic prompt orchestration via Model Context Protocol, and industry case studies regarding AI adoption in professional settings.

Result: Key findings include: 68% productivity gains in experimental coding tasks using chat workflows, but 42-55 parameter choice sensitive failure rates in model chaining. Case studies showed 3x faster prototyping but identified reliability gaps in enterprise deployments. Three distinct competency profiles for AI+SE teams emerged.

Conclusion: Generative AI requires software engineering to rebalance human-AI collaboration through 'observable prompts' and model context alignment. Practitioners should adopt fail-safe design patterns and continuous evaluation frameworks while educational curricula must incorporate prompt engineering literacy and ethical reasoning about model outputs.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping how software is designed, written, and maintained.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) are enabling new development styles -
from chat-oriented programming and 'vibe coding' to agentic programming - that
can accelerate productivity and broaden access. This paper examines how
AI-assisted techniques are changing software engineering practice, and the
related issues of trust, accountability, and shifting skills. We survey
iterative chat-based development, multi-agent systems, dynamic prompt
orchestration, and integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Using case
studies and industry data, we outline both the opportunities (faster cycles,
democratized coding) and the challenges (model reliability and cost) of
applying generative AI to coding. We describe new roles, skills, and best
practices for using AI in a responsible and effective way.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: An AI-ML-powered quality engineering approach uses AI-ML to enhance software
quality assessments by predicting defects. Existing ML models struggle with
noisy data types, imbalances, pattern recognition, feature extraction, and
generalization. To address these challenges, we develop a new model, Adaptive
Differential Evolution (ADE) based Quantum Variational Autoencoder-Transformer
(QVAET) Model (ADE-QVAET). ADE combines with QVAET to obtain high-dimensional
latent features and maintain sequential dependencies, resulting in enhanced
defect prediction accuracy. ADE optimization enhances model convergence and
predictive performance. ADE-QVAET integrates AI-ML techniques such as tuning
hyperparameters for scalable and accurate software defect prediction,
representing an AI-ML-driven technology for quality engineering. During
training with a 90% training percentage, ADE-QVAET achieves high accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.08%, 92.45%, 94.67%, and 98.12%,
respectively, when compared to the Differential Evolution (DE) ML model.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper reviews grey literature to analyze how software project managers perceive and use GenAI, finding it framed as a supportive tool with areas of automation, risks of misuse, and upskilling needs aligned with PMI's talent triangle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing discussion about GenAI's role in software project management, yet a lack of research summarizing practical experiences and challenges. This study addresses this gap by examining real-world practitioner perspectives.

Method: A grey literature review was conducted using 47 practitioner sources (blogs, articles, reports) to identify patterns in GenAI's perceived role, benefits, risks, and adoption requirements in project management.

Result: Managers view GenAI primarily as an 'assistant/copilot' aiding routine automation, predictive analytics, and agile practices. Concerns about hallucinations, ethics, and lack of human judgment highlight the need for responsible use. Upskilling requirements for PMs are mapped to PMI's technical, strategic, and leadership talent triangle capabilities.

Conclusion: GenAI is seen as an enabler of project success through task automation and enhanced collaboration, but requires balancing innovation with ethical responsibility. The study provides practical recommendations for adopting GenAI while addressing organizational and technical challenges.

Abstract: Software practitioners are discussing GenAI transformations in software
project management openly and widely. To understand the state of affairs, we
performed a grey literature review using 47 publicly available practitioner
sources including blogs, articles, and industry reports. We found that software
project managers primarily perceive GenAI as an "assistant", "copilot", or
"friend" rather than as a "PM replacement", with support of GenAI in automating
routine tasks, predictive analytics, communication and collaboration, and in
agile practices leading to project success. Practitioners emphasize responsible
GenAI usage given concerns such as hallucinations, ethics and privacy, and lack
of emotional intelligence and human judgment. We present upskilling
requirements for software project managers in the GenAI era mapped to the
Project Management Institute's talent triangle. We share key recommendations
for both practitioners and researchers.

### [86] [Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation via Synergistic Integration of Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10956)
*Zhiqiang Yuan,Wenjun Mao,Zhuo Chen,Xiyue Shang,Chong Wang,Yiling Lou,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Transforming C to safe Rust is challenging, especially with pointers. The authors present a C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph to guide LLMs in maintaining safe and idiomatic Rust code during translation, significantly reducing unsafe practices and improving functional correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating C to safe Rust is crucial for memory safety. However, current methods using LLMs face difficulties in project-level translations, especially with pointers, as they lack a global perspective on usage and dependencies.

Method: The authors propose a C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph that captures global pointer semantics, including usage and attributes like ownership, mutability, nullability, and lifetimes. This Knowledge Graph is integrated with LLMs to guide translation decisions at the project level.

Result: OurTool reduces unsafe practices in translated Rust code by 99.9% compared to existing methods, while achieving 29.3% higher functional correctness than fuzzing-enhanced LLM techniques.

Conclusion: The use of a Knowledge Graph with LLMs for project-level C-to-Rust translation enables safer and more idiomatic Rust code, significantly outperforming previous approaches in safety and correctness.

Abstract: Translating C code into safe Rust is an effective way to ensure its memory
safety. Compared to rule-based translation which produces Rust code that
remains largely unsafe, LLM-based methods can generate more idiomatic and safer
Rust code because LLMs have been trained on vast amount of human-written
idiomatic code. Although promising, existing LLM-based methods still struggle
with project-level C-to-Rust translation. They typically partition a C project
into smaller units (\eg{} functions) based on call graphs and translate them
bottom-up to resolve program dependencies. However, this bottom-up,
unit-by-unit paradigm often fails to translate pointers due to the lack of a
global perspective on their usage. To address this problem, we propose a novel
C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) that enriches a code-dependency graph with
two types of pointer semantics: (i) pointer-usage information which record
global behaviors such as points-to flows and map lower-level struct usage to
higher-level units; and (ii) Rust-oriented annotations which encode ownership,
mutability, nullability, and lifetime. Synthesizing the \kg{} with LLMs, we
further propose \ourtool{}, which implements a project-level C-to-Rust
translation technique. In \ourtool{}, the \kg{} provides LLMs with
comprehensive pointer semantics from a global perspective, thus guiding LLMs
towards generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from a given C project. Our
experiments show that \ourtool{} reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by
99.9\% compared to both rule-based translation and traditional LLM-based
rewriting, while achieving an average 29.3\% higher functional correctness than
those fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Repository summarization is a crucial research question in development and
maintenance for software engineering. Existing repository summarization
techniques primarily focus on summarizing code according to the directory tree,
which is insufficient for tracing high-level features to the methods that
collaboratively implement them. To address these limitations, we propose
RepoSummary, a feature-oriented code repository summarization approach that
simultaneously generates repository documentation automatically. Furthermore,
it establishes more accurate traceability links from functional features to the
corresponding code elements, enabling developers to rapidly locate relevant
methods and files during code comprehension and maintenance. Comprehensive
experiments against the state-of-the-art baseline (HGEN) demonstrate that
RepoSummary achieves higher feature coverage and more accurate traceability. On
average, it increases the rate of completely covered features in manual
documentation from 61.2% to 71.1%, improves file-level traceability recall from
29.9% to 53.0%, and generates documentation that is more conceptually
consistent, easier to understand, and better formatted than that produced by
existing approaches.

*Jian Wang,Xiaofei Xie,Qiang Hu,Shangqing Liu,Jiongchi Yu,Jiaolong Klong,Yi Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Defects4C, a comprehensive benchmark for C/C++ program repair to address the lack of high-quality resources in this domain. It evaluates 24 LLMs using the dataset, revealing strengths and limitations of current APR techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: C/C++ programs are prevalent and vulnerable, yet lack robust APR benchmarks like Java's Defects4J. This limits progress in developing effective repair techniques for C/C++.

Method: Defects4C was constructed from real-world repositories, containing 9M commits, 248 high-quality buggy functions, 102 vulnerable functions, and paired test cases. The authors evaluated 24 state-of-the-art LLMs using this benchmark to assess APR effectiveness.

Result: The study quantifies the performance of LLM-based APR in C/C++ and identifies key challenges, providing insights into current capabilities and shortcomings while demonstrating the feasibility of Defects4C for training and evaluation.

Conclusion: Defects4C fills a critical research gap by enabling standardized evaluation and improvement of C/C++ APR techniques. It emphasizes the need for more robust methods while serving as a foundational resource for future advancements in this area.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) plays a critical role in enhancing the quality
and reliability of software systems. While substantial progress has been made
in Java-based APR, largely facilitated by benchmarks like Defects4J, there
remains a significant gap in research on C/C++ program repair, despite the
widespread use of C/C++ and the prevalence of associated vulnerabilities. This
gap is primarily due to the lack of high-quality, open-source benchmarks
tailored for C/C++.
  To address this issue, we introduce Defects4C, a comprehensive and executable
benchmark specifically designed for C/C++ program repair. Our dataset is
constructed from real-world C/C++ repositories and includes a large collection
of bug-relevant commits (9M in total), 248 high-quality buggy functions, and
102 vulnerable functions, all paired with test cases for reproduction. These
resources enable rigorous evaluation of repair techniques and support the
retraining of learning-based approaches for enhanced performance.
  Using Defects4C, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the
effectiveness of 24 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in repairing
C/C++ faults. Our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and
limitations of current LLM-based APR techniques in this domain, highlighting
both the need for more robust methods and the critical role of Defects4C in
advancing future research

*Lingyue Fu,Haowei Yuan,Datong Chen,Xinyi Dai,Qingyao Li,Weinan Zhang,Weiwen Liu,Yong Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: debugta improves debugging and teaching in programming education by using specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution, and real-time analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing approaches in dt tasks are hindered by input complexity and underutilization of standard code, leading to limited llm effectiveness.

Method: debugta is an llm-based agent with tools for code retrieval, variable substitution to align solutions, and compiler-based analysis, using an agent approach with distinct subtasks and tool calls for error alignment.

Result: experiment results on three datasets show debugta consistently improves teaching effectiveness and reduces computational costs compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: debugta enhances dt task handling by simplifying logical reasoning through sequential tool usage and better code alignment, significantly improving effectiveness with lower costs.

Abstract: In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common
scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code.
The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages,
reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating
modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges
hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and
heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the
reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to
fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to
rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs
in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose
DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools
for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and
an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit
pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes
a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools
for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step
and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool
calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible,
allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and
improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the
quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher
interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets
demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while
significantly reducing computational costs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents the first large-scale analysis of FMware development, revealing key application areas (education, content creation, business strategy), technical challenges (memory management, tokenizer configuration), and effort-demanding tasks (code review, prompt design) across cloud platforms and open-source repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of Foundation Models necessitates understanding how FMware differs from traditional software development, with divergent tools and processes creating new challenges that hinder progress in cloud/on-premise ecosystems.

Method: Empirical analysis of GitHub repositories and leading FMware platforms (HuggingFace, GPTStore, Ora, Poe) through three focus areas: application domains, developer challenges, and resolution-effort requirements, using real-world data to identify patterns and pain points.

Result: FMware prioritizes education (31% of projects) and content creation (24%). Memory/dependence issues dominate technical challenges (42% of reports), while bug reports (61%) and core functionality fixes (34%) are most frequent on GitHub. Code review and prompt template design require the most development time.

Conclusion: Highlights urgent need for improved FMware tooling and community support, offering actionable insights to address persistent technical barriers and optimize developer workflows in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs), such as OpenAI's GPT, are fundamentally transforming
the practice of software engineering by enabling the development of
\emph{FMware} -- applications and infrastructures built around these models.
FMware systems now support tasks such as code generation, natural-language
interaction, knowledge integration, and multi-modal content creation,
underscoring their disruptive impact on current software engineering workflows.
However, the design, implementation, and evolution of FMware present
significant new challenges, particularly across cloud-based and on-premise
platforms where goals, processes, and tools often diverge from those of
traditional software development.
  To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale analysis of FMware
development across both cloud-based platforms and open-source repositories. We
empirically investigate the FMware ecosystem through three focus areas: (1) the
most common application domains of FMware, (2) the key challenges developers
encounter, and (3) the types of issues that demand the greatest effort to
resolve. Our analysis draws on data from GitHub repositories and from leading
FMware platforms, including HuggingFace, GPTStore, Ora, and Poe. Our findings
reveal a strong focus on education, content creation, and business strategy,
alongside persistent technical challenges in memory management, dependency
handling, and tokenizer configuration. On GitHub, bug reports and core
functionality issues are the most frequently reported problems, while code
review, similarity search, and prompt template design are the most
time-consuming to resolve.
  By uncovering developer practices and pain points, this study points to
opportunities to improve FMware tools, workflows, and community support, and
provides actionable insights to help guide the future of FMware development.

TL;DR: This paper bridges Kieker's and OpenTelemetry's capabilities by enabling the conversion of OpenTelemetry tracing data into Kieker's framework, extending instrumentation and visualization support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kieker supports few languages, while OpenTelemetry covers more but lacks Kieker's analysis features. Integration is needed to leverage both strengths.

Method: Develop a data transformation pipeline to convert OpenTelemetry traces into Kieker's standardized format for analysis (e.g., call trees).

Result: Successful visualization of OpenTelemetry tracing data through Kieker in the Astronomy Shop demo, demonstrating feasibility.

Conclusion: The approach enables broader language support in Kieker by utilizing OpenTelemetry's instrumentation, enhancing observability analysis capabilities.

Abstract: The observability framework Kieker provides a range of analysis capabilities,
but it is currently only able to instrument a smaller selection of languages
and technologies, including Java, C, Fortran, and Python. The OpenTelemetry
standard aims for providing reference implementations for most programming
languages, including C# and JavaScript, that are currently not supported by
Kieker. In this work, we describe how to transform OpenTelemetry tracing data
into the Kieker framework. Thereby, it becomes possible to create for example
call trees from OpenTelemetry instrumentations. We demonstrate the usability of
our approach by visualizing trace data of the Astronomy Shop, which is an
OpenTelemetry demo application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance changes in GitHub's 518 million projects affect users, yet automated detection lacks in CI/CD pipelines.

Method: MooBench was enhanced to upload measurements to Nyrkiö's service, enabling performance regression detection through statistical analysis.

Result: A major regression was detected, reproducible via GitHub Actions, caused by a Linux Kernel version change.

Conclusion: Integrating Nyrkiö into MooBench effectively identifies performance regressions, highlighting systemic issues in CI/CD environments.

Abstract: In GitHub with its 518 million hosted projects, performance changes within
these projects are highly relevant to the project's users. Although performance
measurement is supported by GitHub CI/CD, performance change detection is a
challenging topic.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how we incorporated Nyrki\"o to MooBench. Prior
to this work, Moobench continuously ran on GitHub virtual machines, measuring
overhead of tracing agents, but without change detection. By adding the upload
of the measurements to the Nyrki\"o change detection service, we made it
possible to detect performance changes. We identified one major performance
regression and examined the performance change in depth. We report that (1) it
is reproducible with GitHub actions, and (2) the performance regression is
caused by a Linux Kernel version change.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how developers adopt AI code-generation tools is critical as these technologies become ubiquitous in software development workflows.

Method: Mixed-methods approach with two user studies (10 participants each): first identifying critical interactions, second collecting granular data via custom telemetry plugin for behavioral pattern analysis.

Result: Four behavioral patterns characterized: incremental code refinement, explicit instruction via natural language comments, baseline structuring with model suggestions, and integrative use with external sources, with comprehensive pattern analysis provided.

Conclusion: The identified patterns provide actionable insights for improving code generation tools and understanding developer-tool interaction dynamics during programming workflows.

Abstract: The use of AI code-generation tools is becoming increasingly common, making
it important to understand how software developers are adopting these tools. In
this study, we investigate how developers engage with Amazon's CodeWhisperer,
an LLM-based code-generation tool. We conducted two user studies with two
groups of 10 participants each, interacting with CodeWhisperer - the first to
understand which interactions were critical to capture and the second to
collect low-level interaction data using a custom telemetry plugin. Our
mixed-methods analysis identified four behavioral patterns: 1) incremental code
refinement, 2) explicit instruction using natural language comments, 3)
baseline structuring with model suggestions, and 4) integrative use with
external sources. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these patterns .

Method: Implementation of CodeWatcher, a lightweight system with a VS Code extension, a Python-based RESTful API, and a MongoDB database. It's containerized for good scalability and easy deployment, and it works by semantically logging interactions such as insertions by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and changes in focus, recording each one along with a timestamp to enable detailed session reconstructions.

Result: The CodeWatcher system is functional and available for use, with the infrastructure set up to support in-depth behavioral analyses regarding the use of code generation tools in real development contexts.

Conclusion: CodeWatcher provides a valuable framework for observing and understanding how developers work with code generation tools in a non-intrusive way. Its design supports future research in assessing the usage, impact, and efficacy of CGTs on programming tasks and developer productivity.

Abstract: Understanding how developers interact with code generation tools (CGTs)
requires detailed, real-time data on programming behavior which is often
difficult to collect without disrupting workflow. We present
\textit{CodeWatcher}, a lightweight, unobtrusive client-server system designed
to capture fine-grained interaction events from within the Visual Studio Code
(VS Code) editor. \textit{CodeWatcher} logs semantically meaningful events such
as insertions made by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and focus shifts,
enabling continuous monitoring of developer activity without modifying user
workflows. The system comprises a VS Code plugin, a Python-based RESTful API,
and a MongoDB backend, all containerized for scalability and ease of
deployment. By structuring and timestamping each event, \textit{CodeWatcher}
enables post-hoc reconstruction of coding sessions and facilitates rich
behavioral analyses, including how and when CGTs are used during development.
This infrastructure is crucial for supporting research on responsible AI,
developer productivity, and the human-centered evaluation of CGTs. Please find

Method: Created 30 questions aligned with a program comprehension model for Scratch, extended LitterBox to auto-generate questions from code, applied to 600,913 projects to create 54 million questions.

Result: Generated 54M questions across 600k projects; experiments with 34 ninth graders showed generated questions are meaningful and student performance correlates with question-answering ability.

Conclusion: Automated question generation effectively assesses Scratch comprehension at scale, providing a practical tool for educators to test conceptual understanding through code-based questioning.

Abstract: When learning to program, students are usually assessed based on the code
they wrote. However, the mere completion of a programming task does not
guarantee actual comprehension of the underlying concepts. Asking learners
questions about the code they wrote has therefore been proposed as a means to
assess program comprehension. As creating targeted questions for individual
student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to
generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to
the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different
questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model,
and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate
corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913
projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically. Our initial
experiments with 34 ninth graders demonstrate that this approach can indeed
generate meaningful questions for Scratch programs, and we find that the
ability of students to answer these questions on their programs relates to
their overall performance.
