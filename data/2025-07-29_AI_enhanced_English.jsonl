While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,\na subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives\n-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing\nthese errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often\ngenerate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability\nerror demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,\noften spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system\nthat integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a\nnullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived\nfrom manual analysis of 200 real-world errors.
