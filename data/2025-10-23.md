### [1] [The Black Tuesday Attack: how to crash the stock market with adversarial examples to financial forecasting models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18990)
*Thomas Hofweber,Jefrey Bergl,Ian Reyes,Amir Sadovnik*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the risk of triggering financial market crashes or losses via coordinated small changes to individual stocks to create adversarial examples for financial forecasting models, also identifying defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The article's authors seek to research this threat to prompt urgent action and increase awareness of this issue, which they believe is underestimated, to improve the resilience of financial systems against adversarial attacks. The investigation is prompted by the concern that these kinds of attacks may pose a major risk to financial stability and lead to significant economic losses for adversaries. These risks may exist in whole economies and individual stocks.

Method: The authors begin by analyzing the possibility of triggering a financial market crash by making small, coordinated changes to individual stock values, which collectively create an adversarial example for financial forecasting models. Next, they outline four parts of the investigation: how such an attack might proceed, its theoretical basis and economic damage, how it can be directed towards a whole economy or companies, and the defenses that could be used against it. They conclude that this issue is underappreciated and requires urgent research and defensive action.

Result: The paper finds that intentionally targeted stock market manipulations can successfully trigger self-fufilling crashes by the forecast model, and describes the specific methods and defenses for such threats. The authors point out that this threat could be directed at an entire economy or an individual company and pose a significant risk to financial stability.

Conclusion: The article concludes that the threat of causing financial market volatility through adversarial manipulation remains significantly underestimated and urgent research and defense mechanisms are needed to safeguard the financial system. The authors propose that the financial industry must focus on defenses, including changes to the structure of algorithms used by forecasting models, to protect against manipulation.

Abstract: We investigate and defend the possibility of causing a stock market crash via
small manipulations of individual stock values that together realize an
adversarial example to financial forecasting models, causing these models to
make the self-fulfilling prediction of a crash. Such a crash triggered by an
adversarial example would likely be hard to detect, since the model's
predictions would be accurate and the interventions that would cause it are
minor. This possibility is a major risk to financial stability and an
opportunity for hostile actors to cause great economic damage to an adversary.
This threat also exists against individual stocks and the corresponding
valuation of individual companies. We outline how such an attack might proceed,
what its theoretical basis is, how it can be directed towards a whole economy
or an individual company, and how one might defend against it. We conclude that
this threat is vastly underappreciated and requires urgent research on how to
defend against it.

### [2] [Fusion of Machine Learning and Blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving Approach for Health Care Data in the Internet of Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19026)
*Behnam Rezaei Bezanjani,Seyyed Hamid Ghafouri,Reza Gholamrezaei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel three-phase intrusion detection method for IoT-based healthcare systems. It compares the method with existing approaches and shows it outperforms them in detection and evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of IoT in healthcare has introduced critical security challenges, necessitating robust solutions to protect sensitive patient data against cyber threats.

Method: The proposed method consists of three phases: 1) Blockchain-Enabled Request and Transaction Encryption to secure data transactions, 2) Request Pattern Recognition Check to detect unauthorized access attempts using diverse data sources, and 3) Feature Selection with a BiLSTM network to improve intrusion detection accuracy and efficiency via machine learning.

Result: The simulation results show the proposed method surpasses recent approaches like AIBPSF-IoMT, OMLIDS-PBIoT, and AIMMFIDS in all key performance metrics including detection rate, false alarm rate, precision, recall, and accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed method effectively enhances the security of IoT-based healthcare systems by combining blockchain encryption, pattern recognition, and BiLSTM-based intrusion detection.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices
into the healthcare sector has brought about revolutionary advancements in
patient care and data management. While these technological innovations hold
immense promise, they concurrently raise critical security concerns,
particularly in safeguarding medical data against potential cyber threats. The
sensitive nature of health-related information requires robust measures to
ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data in
IoT-enabled medical environments. Addressing the imperative need for enhanced
security in IoT-based healthcare systems, we propose a comprehensive method
encompassing three distinct phases. In the first phase, we implement
Blockchain-Enabled Request and Transaction Encryption to strengthen data
transaction security, providing an immutable and transparent framework. In the
second phase, we introduce a Request Pattern Recognition Check that leverages
diverse data sources to identify and block potential unauthorized access
attempts. Finally, the third phase incorporates Feature Selection and a BiLSTM
network to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of intrusion detection using
advanced machine learning techniques. We compared the simulation results of the
proposed method with three recent related methods: AIBPSF-IoMT, OMLIDS-PBIoT,
and AIMMFIDS. The evaluation criteria include detection rate, false alarm rate,
precision, recall, and accuracy - crucial benchmarks for assessing the overall
performance of intrusion detection systems. Our findings show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across all evaluated criteria,
demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the security of IoT-based
healthcare systems.

### [3] [CosmoCore Affective Dream-Replay Reinforcement Learning for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18895)
*Santhosh Kumar Ravindran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CosmoCore integrates affective signals into LLM code generation via RL, reducing hallucinations by 48% and accelerating self-correction by 45%. It uses valence/surprise tags and a Dream Queue for error prioritization, with applications in IDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human/animal learning via emotional feedback (e.g., embarrassment from errors), the paper addresses the inefficiency of traditional RLHF in prioritizing code generation corrections.

Method: A lightweight MLP tags code trajectories with valence (cringe) and surprise; high-valence errors are prioritized in a Dream Queue for five-fold replay, while low-surprise successes are pruned. Evaluated via HumanEval, BigCodeBench, and custom simulated environments.

Result: Reduces hallucinated code by 48% and accelerates self-correction by 45% (validated on Hugging Face models in PySpark). Ablations confirm valence tagging boosts exploration and pruning improves efficiency.

Conclusion: CosmoCore extends RLHF to incorporate emotional awareness, offering a framework for more reliable code assistants in IDEs and data pipelines, with released code and simulations for replication.

Abstract: We introduce CosmoCore, a neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning (RL)
architecture that integrates affective signals to enhance code generation in
large language models (LLMs). Motivated by human and animal learning where
embarrassment from mistakes drives rapid correction, as observed in training a
puppy to avoid repeating errors after a single scolding CosmoCore tags code
generation trajectories with valence and surprise using a lightweight
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). High-negative valence (cringe) episodes, such as
buggy code outputs, are prioritized in a Dream Queue for five-fold replay
during off-policy updates, while low-surprise successes are pruned to prevent
overconfidence and buffer bloat. Evaluated on code generation benchmarks like
HumanEval and BigCodeBench, alongside simulations with a custom data pipeline
environment, CosmoCore reduces hallucinated code (e.g., syntax errors or
logical bugs) by 48\% and accelerates self-correction by 45\%. Local
experiments using Hugging Face models in a PySpark environment validate these
gains, with code snippets provided for replication. Ablations confirm valence
tagging boosts curiosity in exploration, and pruning mitigates inefficiency.
This framework extends RL from human feedback (RLHF) for more emotionally aware
code assistants, with applications in IDEs and data pipelines. Code and the
custom mini-world simulation are released.

### [4] [A Survey on Feedback Types in Automated Programming Assessment Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18923)
*Eduard Frankford,Tobias Antensteiner,Michael Vierhauser,Clemens Sauerwein,Vivien Wallner,Iris Groher,Reinhold Pl√∂sch,Ruth Breu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores the effectiveness of different feedback mechanisms in Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) on student learning and problem-solving performance, comparing compiler and unit test feedback with AI-generated feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for programming education across diverse academic fields necessitates better teaching, grading, and tutoring resources. Current APASs using unit tests have limited feedback capacity, while advances in Large Language Models (LLL) enable new possibilities for high-quality, personalized assessment feedback.

Method: A large-scale comparative study involving over 200 university students evaluated three feedback types: 1) Compiler feedback, 2) Unit test feedback (current APAS standard), and 3) LLM-based feedback (advanced AI approach). The study measures perceived feedback quality and student performance outcomes.

Result: Surprisingly, while students found unit test feedback most helpful, AI-generated feedback showed significantly better learning outcomes. The LLM feedback helped students improve both problem-solving approaches and code refinement, leading to higher performance scores than alternative methods.

Conclusion: The study recommends a hybrid approach where APASs combine traditional unit testing with AI-driven guidance. This combination offers strengths of standardized testing with the increased personalization and effectiveness of LLM-based feedback to enhance programming education outcomes.

Abstract: With the recent rapid increase in digitization across all major industries,
acquiring programming skills has increased the demand for introductory
programming courses. This has further resulted in universities integrating
programming courses into a wide range of curricula, including not only
technical studies but also business and management fields of study.
  Consequently, additional resources are needed for teaching, grading, and
tutoring students with diverse educational backgrounds and skills. As part of
this, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing
scalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and
instant feedback. Commonly, APASs heavily rely on predefined unit tests for
generating feedback, often limiting the scope and level of detail of feedback
that can be provided to students. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
in recent years, new opportunities have emerged as these technologies can
enhance feedback quality and personalization.
  To investigate how different feedback mechanisms in APASs are perceived by
students, and how effective they are in supporting problem-solving, we have
conducted a large-scale study with over 200 students from two different
universities. Specifically, we compare baseline Compiler Feedback, standard
Unit Test Feedback, and advanced LLM-based Feedback regarding perceived quality
and impact on student performance.
  Results indicate that while students rate unit test feedback as the most
helpful, AI-generated feedback leads to significantly better performances.
These findings suggest combining unit tests and AI-driven guidance to optimize
automated feedback mechanisms and improve learning outcomes in programming
education.

### [5] [Extending Resource Constrained Project Scheduling to Mega-Projects with Model-Based Systems Engineering & Hetero-functional Graph Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19035)
*Amirreza Hosseini,Amro M. Farid*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper bridges the gap between RCPSP and MBSE by developing a translation pipeline and specializes HFGT for RCPSP, enhancing project monitoring and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to connect the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) with model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT), addressing the lack of integration in managing complex systems.

Method: The authors created a translation pipeline converting activity-on-node networks to SysML activity diagrams and operand nets. They specialized the hetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation for RCPSP and demonstrated its application through an illustrative instance with both renewable and non-renewable operands.

Result: The specialized HFNMCF formulation showed that RCPSP can be recovered as a special case of a broader model, and it produced similar project schedules while providing explicit explanations of project states, facilitating better monitoring and control.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates RCPSP within MBSE and HFGT, preserving traditional strengths while supporting complex, real-world project constraints and decision-making in megaprojects, marking a significant advancement in project scheduling theory and application.

Abstract: Within the project management context, project scheduling serves as an
indispensable component, functioning as a fundamental tool for planning,
monitoring, controlling, and managing projects more broadly. Although the
resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of
project management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader
literature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its
integration into the design and management of complex systems. The original
contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the
RCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems
engineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation
pipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then
to an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the
hetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP
context as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that
the RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an
illustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the
specialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit
explanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control.
Overall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while
accommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes
encountered in large, complex megaprojects.

### [7] [Automated Concern Extraction from Textual Requirements of Cyber-Physical Systems: A Multi-solution Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19237)
*Dongming Jin,Zhi Jin,Xiaohong Chen,Zheng Fang,Linyu Li,Shengxin Zhao,Chuihui Wang,Hongbin Xiao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReqEBench, a new benchmark for requirements concern extraction in cyber-physical systems (CPSs), evaluates automated solutions (including GPT-4), and highlights significant performance gaps in entity concern extraction (max F1 score 0.24).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deep integration of information and physical systems in CPSs complicates requirement extraction. Existing automated solutions lack fair evaluation benchmarks to guide improvement.

Method: Authors created ReqEBench with 2,721 real-world CPSs requirements (12 projects) and four design advantages: real-world alignment, comprehensive concern coverage, rigorous annotation, and multi-domain applicability. Conducted comparative studies across three automated extraction solution types.

Result: 1) Even GPT-4 achieves only 0.24 F1 score in entity concern extraction. 2)Large language model-based methods show significant shortcomings. 3) Failure case analysis reveals systematic limitations in handling CPSs-specific concerns.

Conclusion: ReqEBench provides a foundational benchmark for advancing automated CPSs requirement extraction. The low performance highlights urgent need for improved methods addressing CPSs-specific challenges in automated concern extraction.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are characterized by a deep integration of the
information space and the physical world, which makes the extraction of
requirements concerns more challenging. Some automated solutions for
requirements concern extraction have been proposed to alleviate the burden on
requirements engineers. However, evaluating the effectiveness of these
solutions, which relies on fair and comprehensive benchmarks, remains an open
question. To address this gap, we propose ReqEBench, a new CPSs requirements
concern extraction benchmark, which contains 2,721 requirements from 12
real-world CPSs. ReqEBench offers four advantages. It aligns with real-world
CPSs requirements in multiple dimensions, e.g., scale and complexity. It covers
comprehensive concerns related to CPSs requirements. It undergoes a rigorous
annotation process. It covers multiple application domains of CPSs, e.g.,
aerospace and healthcare. We conducted a comparative study on three types of
automated requirements concern extraction solutions and revealed their
performance in real-world CPSs using our ReqEBench. We found that the highest
F1 score of GPT-4 is only 0.24 in entity concern extraction. We further analyze
failure cases of popular LLM-based solutions, summarize their shortcomings, and
provide ideas for improving their capabilities. We believe ReqEBench will
facilitate the evaluation and development of automated requirements concern
extraction.
