Currently, developers most\ncommonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and\nwidely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code\nsearch tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic\nstructure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to\nsystematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools\noperate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be\ndifficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural\nlanguage to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural\nlanguage provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to\nentry.\n  In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning\ncapabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the\npower of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve\nrelevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search\nDSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for\nstructural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show\nthat our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to\nDSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision\nand recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly\noutperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to\n57% and 14% on F1 scores."}

We begin by identifying attention heads predictive of refusal\nbehavior for private attributes (e.g., sexual orientation) using lightweight\nlinear probes trained with privacy evaluator labels. Next, we steer the\nactivations of a small subset of these attention heads guided by the trained\nprobes to induce the model to generate non-refusal responses. Our experiments\nshow that these steered responses often disclose sensitive attribute details,\nalong with other private information about data subjects such as life events,\nrelationships, and personal histories that the models would typically refuse to\nproduce. Evaluations across four LLMs reveal jailbreaking disclosure rates of\nat least 95%, with more than 50% on average of these responses revealing true\npersonal information. Our controlled study demonstrates that private\ninformation memorized in LLMs can be extracted through targeted manipulation of\ninternal activations."}

Despite\nthe prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture\nnon-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and\nconditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural\npreservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static\nstructures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual\nprocess complexity characteristics.

Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively\ncombining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and\nemploys reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to\nautomatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process\ninstance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with\nrelation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next\nactivity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential\nand non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive\nevaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

We instrument the\nGPU kernel module -- the only open-source component of the system -- and\nconduct a series of experiments to identify the security weaknesses and\npotential exploits. For certain components that are out of reach through\nexperiments, we propose well-reasoned speculations about their inner working\nmechanisms. We have responsibly reported all security findings presented in\nthis paper to the NVIDIA PSIRT Team."}
