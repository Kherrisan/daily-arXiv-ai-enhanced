These\nagents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be\ncompromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates a\nmechanism to formally guarantee that an agent's actions adhere to predefined\nsafety constraints, a challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We\nintroduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees\nfor LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and\nverifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive\nvalidation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise\nsafety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and\nsubjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance\nwith these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it\nis deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action\nmonitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each\nproposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This\nseparation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online\nmonitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a\nrobust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents."}

However, developing a one-size-fits-all\nIntrusion Detection System (IDS) is challenging because each vehicle has unique\ndata profiles. This is due to the complex and dynamic nature of the data\ngenerated by vehicles regarding their model, driving style, test environment,\nand firmware update. To address this issue, a universal IDS has been developed\nthat can be applied to all types of vehicles without the need for\ncustomization. Unlike conventional IDSs, the universal IDS can adapt to\nevolving data security issues resulting from firmware updates. In this study, a\nnew hybrid approach has been developed, combining Pearson correlation with deep\nlearning techniques. This approach has been tested using data obtained from\nfour distinct mechanical and electronic vehicles, including Tesla, Sonata, and\ntwo Kia models. The data has been combined into two frequency datasets, and\nwavelet transformation has been employed to convert them into the frequency\ndomain, enhancing generalizability. Additionally, a statistical method based on\nindependent rule-based systems using Pearson correlation has been utilized to\nimprove system performance. The system has been compared with eight different\nIDSs, three of which utilize the universal approach, while the remaining five\nare based on conventional techniques. The accuracy of each system has been\nevaluated through benchmarking, and the results demonstrate that the hybrid\nsystem effectively detects intrusions in various vehicle models."}

Existing delegation mechanisms often\nreinforce visibility biases, where a small set of highly ranked delegates\naccumulate disproportionate influence regardless of their alignment with the\nbroader community. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of delegation\nin DAO governance, combining on-chain data from five major protocols with\noff-chain discussions from 14 DAO forums. We develop a methodology to link\nforum participants to on-chain addresses, extract governance interests using\nlarge language models, and compare these interests against delegates'\nhistorical behavior. Our analysis reveals that delegations are frequently\nmisaligned with token holders' expressed priorities and that current\nranking-based interfaces exacerbate power concentration. We argue that\nincorporating interest alignment into delegation processes could mitigate these\nimbalances and improve the representativeness of DAO decision-making."}

Existing machine\nlearning-based detection methods often rely on supervised learning with labeled\ndata, which not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also limits\nadaptability to novel attack patterns. To address these challenges, we propose\nPhishSSL, a self-supervised contrastive learning framework that eliminates the\nneed for labeled phishing data during training. PhishSSL combines hybrid\ntabular augmentation with adaptive feature attention to produce semantically\nconsistent views and emphasize discriminative attributes. We evaluate PhishSSL\non three phishing datasets with distinct feature compositions. Across all\ndatasets, PhishSSL consistently outperforms unsupervised and self-supervised\nbaselines, while ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component.\nMoreover, PhishSSL maintains robust performance despite the diversity of\nfeature sets, highlighting its strong generalization and transferability. These\nresults demonstrate that PhishSSL offers a promising solution for phishing\nwebsite detection, particularly effective against evolving threats in dynamic\nWeb environments."}

However, the provenance of\nprocess adaptations, especially modifications during execu- tion, remains\ninsufficiently addressed. A review of the literature reveals a lack of\nsystematic approaches for capturing provenance information about adaptive\nworkflows/processes. To fill this gap, we propose the AdProv method for\ncollecting, storing, retrieving, and visualizing prove- nance of runtime\nworkflow adaptations. In addition to the definition of the AdProv method in\nterms of steps and concepts like change events, we also present an architecture\nfor a Provenance Holder service that is essential for implementing the method.\nTo ensure semantic consistency and interoperability we define a mapping to the\nontology PROV Ontol- ogy (PROV-O). Additionally, we extend the XES standard\nwith elements for adaptation logging.

In this paper, we propose\na privacy-preserving protocol which tackles structure generation and parameter\nlearning of SPNs. Additionally, we provide a protocol for private inference on\nSPNs, subsequent to training. To preserve the privacy of the participants, we\nderive our protocol based on secret sharing, which guarantees privacy in the\nhonest-but-curious setting even when at most half of the parties cooperate to\ndisclose the data. The protocol makes use of a forest of randomly generated\nSPNs, which is trained and weighted privately and can then be used for private\ninference on data points. Our experiments indicate that preserving the privacy\nof all participants does not decrease log-likelihood performance on both\nhomogeneously and heterogeneously partitioned data. We furthermore show that\nour protocol's performance is comparable to current state-of-the-art SPN\nlearners in homogeneously partitioned data settings. In terms of runtime and\nmemory usage, we demonstrate that our implementation scales well when\nincreasing the number of parties, comparing favorably to protocols for neural\nnetworks, when they are trained to reproduce the input-output behavior of SPNs."}

These\nagents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be\ncompromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates a\nmechanism to formally guarantee that an agent's actions adhere to predefined\nsafety constraints, a challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We\nintroduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees\nfor LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and\nverifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive\nvalidation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise\nsafety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and\nsubjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance\nwith these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it\nis deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action\nmonitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each\nproposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This\nseparation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online\nmonitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a\nrobust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents."}
