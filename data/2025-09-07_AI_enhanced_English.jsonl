Standard higher-security options include NIST P-521, Curve448,\nand Brainpool-P512. This paper presents ECCFROG522PP (\"Presunto Powered\"), a\n522-bit prime-field elliptic curve that delivers security in the same classical\napprox 260-bit ballpark as NIST P-521, but with a fundamentally different\ndesign philosophy. All of the curve parameters are deterministically derived\nfrom a fixed public seed via BLAKE3, with zero hidden choices. The curve has\nprime order (cofactor = 1), a verified twist with a proven approx 505-bit prime\nfactor, safe embedding degree (greater than or equal to 14), and passes\nanti-MOV checks up to k less than or equal to 200 and CM discriminant sanity up\nto 100k. Unlike prior opaque or ad-hoc constructions, ECCFROG522PP is fully\nreproducible: anyone can regenerate and verify it byte-for-byte using the\npublished scripts. The intent is not to outperform NIST P-521 in raw speed, but\nto maximise trust, verifiability, and long-term auditability in a practical\ncurve of equivalent security level", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Failing to\naddress these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,\nand lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions\nfocus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or\nanomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime\nlog-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly\npermissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments\nthrough two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs\nreflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.\nThis approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for\nnew resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.\nKubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,\ndevelopers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our\nevaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s\nmanifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both\nproprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores\naffirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime\nobservability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Bastian"], "title": "An Automated, Scalable Machine Learning Model Inversion Assessment Pipeline", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine learning (ML) models have the potential to transform military\nbattlefields, presenting a large external pressure to rapidly incorporate them\ninto operational settings. However, it is well-established that these ML models\nare vulnerable to a number of adversarial attacks throughout the model\ndeployment pipeline that threaten to negate battlefield advantage. One broad\ncategory is privacy attacks (such as model inversion) where an adversary can\nreverse engineer information from the model, such as the sensitive data used in\nits training. The ability to quantify the risk of model inversion attacks\n(MIAs) is not well studied, and there is a lack of automated developmental test\nand evaluation (DT&E) tools and metrics to quantify the effectiveness of\nprivacy loss of the MIA. The current DT&E process is difficult because ML model\ninversions can be hard for a human to interpret, subjective when they are\ninterpretable, and difficult to quantify in terms of inversion quality.\nAdditionally, scaling the DT&E process is challenging due to many ML model\narchitectures and data modalities that need to be assessed. In this work, we\npresent a novel DT&E tool that quantifies the risk of data privacy loss from\nMIAs and introduces four adversarial risk dimensions to quantify privacy loss.\nOur DT&E pipeline combines inversion with vision language models (VLMs) to\nimprove effectiveness while enabling scalable analysis. We demonstrate\neffectiveness using multiple MIA techniques and VLMs configured for zero-shot\nclassification and image captioning. We benchmark the pipeline using several\nstate-of-the-art MIAs in the computer vision domain with an image\nclassification task that is typical in military applications.
