Their next\ngeneration is agent-based, operating with more autonomy and potentially without\nhuman oversight. One challenge is to provide AI agents with sufficient context\nabout the software projects they operate in. Like humans, AI agents require\ncontextual information to develop solutions that are in line with the target\narchitecture, interface specifications, coding guidelines, standard workflows,\nand other project-specific policies. Popular AI agents for software development\n(e.g., Claude Code) advocate for maintaining tool-specific version-controlled\nMarkdown files that cover aspects such as the project structure, building and\ntesting, or code style. The content of these files is automatically added to\neach prompt. AGENTS.md has emerged as a potential standard that consolidates\ntool-specific formats. However, little is known about whether and how\ndevelopers adopt this format. Therefore, in this paper, we present the results\nof a preliminary study investigating the adoption of AI configuration files in\n466 open-source software projects, what information developers provide in these\nfiles, how they present that information, and how they evolve over time. Our\nfindings indicate that there is no established structure yet, and that there is\na lot of variation in terms of how context is provided (descriptive,\nprescriptive, prohibitive, explanatory, conditional). We see great potential in\nstudying which modifications in structure or presentation can positively affect\nthe quality of the generated content.

A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly\nalarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image,\nwithout requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial\nand vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass\nindustry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and\nMicrosoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are\nfar easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering\nthe barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core\nresearch questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors\nreliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and\n(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection\nwithout overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators\nsuch as SpeechT5.\n  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic\nevaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail\nunder both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted\nfine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding\nsignificant accuracy improvements.
