### [1] [Performance Evaluation and Threat Mitigation in Large-scale 5G Core Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17850)
*Rodrigo Moreira,Larissa F. Rodrigues Moreira,Fl√°vio de Oliveira Silva*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines how DDoS-induced chaotic workloads affect 5G core network functions' (NFs) user equipment registration performance, emphasizing the need for diverse resource profiles and kernel-based monitoring for SLA compliance and scalable security in complex 5G deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale 5G core functions face critical challenges in resource provisioning, especially under DDoS attacks, which necessitate efficient strategies to maintain SLA compliance and secure deployments.

Method: The study analyzes the impact of chaotic DDoS workloads on NF registration performance, evaluates packet capture approaches, and conducts empirical assessments to derive deployment insights.


Result: Results demonstrate that diverse resource profiles are essential for SLA compliance under chaotic workloads, and kernel-based monitoring enables scalable defense against security threats like DDoS.


Conclusion: The paper concludes that adaptive resource provisioning and kernel-level monitoring are crucial for reliable 5G core operations in complex scenarios with dynamic security threats.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale software-based 5G core functions presents
significant challenges due to their reliance on optimized and intelligent
resource provisioning for their services. Many studies have focused on
analyzing the impact of resource allocation for complex deployments using
mathematical models, queue theories, or even Artificial Intelligence (AI). This
paper elucidates the effects of chaotic workloads, generated by Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) on different Network Functions (NFs) on User Equipment
registration performance. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse
resource profiles to ensure Service-Level Agreement (SLA) compliance in
large-scale 5G core deployments. Additionally, our analysis of packet capture
approaches demonstrates the potential of kernel-based monitoring for scalable
security threat defense. Finally, our empirical evaluation provides insights
into the effective deployment of 5G NFs in complex scenarios.

### [2] [Learning to Locate: GNN-Powered Vulnerability Path Discovery in Open Source Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17888)
*Nima Atashin,Behrouz Tork Ladani,Mohammadreza Sharbaf*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Introduces VulPathFinder, an explainable vulnerability path discovery framework using a novel GNN to detect sink statements, improving upon rule-based approaches like SliceLocator and outperforming general GNN explainability methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vulnerability detectors lack ability to explain root causes through precise path discovery and statement localization, as rule-based sink identification limits generalization in frameworks like SliceLocator.

Method: 1) Novel GNN model identifies sink statements capturing semantic/syntactic dependencies.
2) Potential Sink Points (PSPs) identified, followed by program slicing to extract vulnerable paths.
3) Ranking algorithm feeds paths back to graph-based detectors for probability assessment.

Result: Outperformed SliceLocator and GNNExplainer in path discovery for buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CWEs) using the SARD dataset benchmark.

Conclusion: VulPathFinder provides more accurate and explainable vulnerability paths than existing approaches by integrating GNN-based sink detection with iterative path ranking.

Abstract: Detecting security vulnerabilities in open-source software is a critical task
that is highly regarded in the related research communities. Several approaches
have been proposed in the literature for detecting vulnerable codes and
identifying the classes of vulnerabilities. However, there is still room to
work in explaining the root causes of detected vulnerabilities through locating
vulnerable statements and the discovery of paths leading to the activation of
the vulnerability. While frameworks like SliceLocator offer explanations by
identifying vulnerable paths, they rely on rule-based sink identification that
limits their generalization. In this paper, we introduce VulPathFinder, an
explainable vulnerability path discovery framework that enhances SliceLocator's
methodology by utilizing a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for detecting
sink statements, rather than relying on predefined rules. The proposed GNN
captures semantic and syntactic dependencies to find potential sink points
(PSPs), which are candidate statements where vulnerable paths end. After
detecting PSPs, program slicing can be used to extract potentially vulnerable
paths, which are then ranked by feeding them back into the target graph-based
detector. Ultimately, the most probable path is returned, explaining the root
cause of the detected vulnerability. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the
proposed approach by performing evaluations on a benchmark of the buffer
overflow CWEs from the SARD dataset, providing explanations for the
corresponding detected vulnerabilities. The results show that VulPathFinder
outperforms both original SliceLocator and GNNExplainer (as a general GNN
explainability tool) in discovery of vulnerability paths to identified PSPs.

*Russell O'Connor,Andrew Poelstra*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper provides a computer-verified proof of the modular inverse implementation in libsecp256k1 using Coq and separation logic, addressing risks from novel algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular inverse computation is critical for elliptic curve operations in Bitcoin, and novel algorithms like Bernstein and Yang's extended Euclidean approach may introduce errors requiring verification.

Method: Computer-verified proofs with Coq proof assistant and Verifiable C's separation logic were applied to libsecp256k1's implementation.

Result: Successful verification of the implementation's correctness for the modular inverse algorithm.

Conclusion: Formal verification ensures reliability of critical cryptographic operations while adopting modern algorithmic improvements.

Abstract: The modular inverse is an essential piece of computation required for
elliptic curve operations used for digital signatures in Bitcoin and other
applications. A novel approach to the extended Euclidean algorithm has been
developed by Bernstein and Yang within the last few years and incorporated into
the libsecp256k1 cryptographic library used by Bitcoin. However, novel
algorithms introduce new risks of errors. To address this we have completed a
computer verified proof of the correctness of (one of) libsecp256k1's modular
inverse implementations with the Coq proof assistant using the Verifiable C's
implementation of separation logic.

### [4] [TimelyHLS: LLM-Based Timing-Aware and Architecture-Specific FPGA HLS Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17962)
*Nowfel Mashnoor,Mohammad Akyash,Hadi Kamali,Kimia Azar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TimelyHLS: An LLM-based framework for automated FPGA HLS code generation and optimization, reducing manual tuning by 70% with up to 4x latency speedup and 57% area savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FPGA HLS design is manual-intensive due to complex interactions between architectural constraints, resource utilization, and platform-specific pragmas, requiring expert knowledge for optimization.

Method: TimelyHLS integrates LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using a structured knowledge base containing FPGA features, synthesis directives, and pragma templates. It automatically generates pragmas-annotated HLS code, iteratively refines using synthesis logs/performance reports, and verifies RTL correctness via commercial toolchains and custom testbenches.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate 70% reduction in manual effort, 4x latency speedup (e.g., 3.85x for Matrix Multiplication, 3.7x for Bitonic Sort), and up to 57% area savings (FF reduction in Viterbi) across 10 FPGA architectures and diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: TimelyHLS shows LLM-driven, architecture-aware synthesis can achieve competitive timing closure, functional correctness, and performance improvements over manual methods, making it a promising automated solution for FPGAdesign optimization.

Abstract: Achieving timing closure and design-specific optimizations in FPGA-targeted
High-Level Synthesis (HLS) remains a significant challenge due to the complex
interaction between architectural constraints, resource utilization, and the
absence of automated support for platform-specific pragmas. In this work, we
propose TimelyHLS, a novel framework integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automatically generate and
iteratively refine HLS code optimized for FPGA-specific timing and performance
requirements. TimelyHLS is driven by a structured architectural knowledge base
containing FPGA-specific features, synthesis directives, and pragma templates.
Given a kernel, TimelyHLS generates HLS code annotated with both
timing-critical and design-specific pragmas. The synthesized RTL is then
evaluated using commercial toolchains, and simulation correctness is verified
against reference outputs via custom testbenches. TimelyHLS iteratively
incorporates synthesis logs and performance reports into the LLM engine for
refinement in the presence of functional discrepancies. Experimental results
across 10 FPGA architectures and diverse benchmarks show that TimelyHLS reduces
the need for manual tuning by up to 70%, while achieving up to 4x latency
speedup (e.g., 3.85x for Matrix Multiplication, 3.7x for Bitonic Sort) and over
50% area savings in certain cases (e.g., 57% FF reduction in Viterbi).
TimelyHLS consistently achieves timing closure and functional correctness
across platforms, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-driven,
architecture-aware synthesis in automating FPGA design.

### [5] [MeAJOR Corpus: A Multi-Source Dataset for Phishing Email Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17978)
*Paulo Mendes,Eva Maia,Isabel Pra√ßa*

Main category: cs.CR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing phishing datasets suffer from class imbalance, limited source diversity, and insufficient phishing tactic coverage, hindering ML model training effectiveness.

Method: Constructed by merging 135894 email samples across open-source repositories, combining phishing and legitimate emails with engineered features from multiple categories. Evaluated using RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN models across varying feature configurations.

phishing threats, their performance largely relies on the quality and diversity
of the training data. This paper presents MeAJOR (Merged email Assets from
Joint Open-source Repositories) Corpus, a novel, multi-source phishing email
dataset designed to overcome critical limitations in existing resources. It
integrates 135894 samples representing a broad number of phishing tactics and
legitimate emails, with a wide spectrum of engineered features. We evaluated
the dataset's utility for phishing detection research through systematic
experiments with four classification models (RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN) across
multiple feature configurations. Results highlight the dataset's effectiveness,
achieving 98.34% F1 with XGB. By integrating broad features from multiple
categories, our dataset provides a reusable and consistent resource, while
addressing common challenges like class imbalance, generalisability and
reproducibility.

### [6] [Removing Box-Free Watermarks for Image-to-Image Models via Query-Based Reverse Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18034)
*Haonan An,Guang Hua,Hangcheng Cao,Zhengru Fang,Guowen Xu,Susanto Rahardja,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper reveals a vulnerability in box-free model watermarking for deep generative networks, demonstrating that attackers can reverse-engineer hidden outputs via query-based methods with high watermark removal success (100%) and image quality (34.69 dB PSNR), surpassing existing attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative network intellectual property protection using box-free watermarking was presumed secure due to black-box encapsulation, but this paper aims to highlight critical vulnerabilities enabling unauthorized extraction of unmarked outputs, urging improvements in defensive strategies.

Method: Two approaches are presented: (1) Reverse-engineering an inverse HNet model under black-box conditions using curated inputs and (2) Leveraging the additive property of box-free watermarking to build a forward surrogate model for better image recovery quality.

Result: Experimental results show 100% watermark removal success across multiple tasks with exceptionally high-quality output (PSNR up to 34.69 dB), significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art attacks.

Conclusion: Current box-free watermarking systems are highly vulnerable to reverse-engineering attacks even with limited attacker knowledge, necessitating immediate development of robust defensive mechanisms to secure deep generative network IP.

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep generative networks (GNets) can be
protected using a cascaded hiding network (HNet) which embeds watermarks (or
marks) into GNet outputs, known as box-free watermarking. Although both GNet
and HNet are encapsulated in a black box (called operation network, or ONet),
with only the generated and marked outputs from HNet being released to end
users and deemed secure, in this paper, we reveal an overlooked vulnerability
in such systems. Specifically, we show that the hidden GNet outputs can still
be reliably estimated via query-based reverse engineering, leaking the
generated and unmarked images, despite the attacker's limited knowledge of the
system. Our first attempt is to reverse-engineer an inverse model for HNet
under the stringent black-box condition, for which we propose to exploit the
query process with specially curated input images. While effective, this method
yields unsatisfactory image quality. To improve this, we subsequently propose
an alternative method leveraging the equivalent additive property of box-free
model watermarking and reverse-engineering a forward surrogate model of HNet,
with better image quality preservation. Extensive experimental results on image
processing and image generation tasks demonstrate that both attacks achieve
impressive watermark removal success rates (100%) while also maintaining
excellent image quality (reaching the highest PSNR of 34.69 dB), substantially
outperforming existing attacks, highlighting the urgent need for robust
defensive strategies to mitigate the identified vulnerability in box-free model
watermarking.

### [7] [NWaaS: Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service for X-to-Image DNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18036)
*Haonan An,Guang Hua,Yu Guo,Hangcheng Cao,Susanto Rahardja,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes ShadowMark, a nonintrusive DNN watermarking method that preserves model fidelity and robustness across different architectures, overcoming the limitations of existing techniques that alter model parameters or structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DNN watermarking methods are intrusive, causing model behavior shifts and requiring costly fine-tuning. This limits practical adoption of Watermarking-as-a-Service (WaaS) systems due to model size growth and deployment challenges.

Method: The authors introduce NWaaS, a trustless paradigm for X-to-Image models, implemented via ShadowMark. It uses a key encoder and watermark decoder to establish a robust side channel through the model's black-box API without modifying the model's architecture or parameters.

Result: Experiments on diverse X-to-Image models (image-to-image, noise-to-image, etc.) demonstrate ShadowMark's efficacy in watermark extraction while maintaining absolute fidelity and robustness against common attacks.

Conclusion: ShadowMark enables practical nonintrusive DNN watermarking by eliminating fidelity-robustness trade-offs, proving its applicability to modern architectures and paving the way for scalable, trustless Watermarking-as-a-Service systems.

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep neural network (DNN) models can be
protected with DNN watermarking, which embeds copyright watermarks into model
parameters (white-box), model behavior (black-box), or model outputs
(box-free), and the watermarks can be subsequently extracted to verify model
ownership or detect model theft. Despite recent advances, these existing
methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or
alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about
watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of
fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a
result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,
which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)
systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a
Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in
which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark
can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose
ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical
deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in
the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark
decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining
the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN
architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating
the fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,
noise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate
the efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of
nonintrusive DNN watermarking.

### [8] [RECALLED: An Unbounded Resource Consumption Attack on Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18053)
*Haoran Gao,Yuanhe Zhang,Zhenhong Zhou,Lei Jiang,Fanyu Meng,Yujia Xiao,Kun Wang,Yang Liu,Junlan Feng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces RECALLED, a method exploiting visual inputs to trigger unbounded Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). It uses Vision Guided Optimization and Multi-Objective Parallel Losses to generate adversarial perturbations, causing significant latency and resource increases. The study highlights security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and provides a red-teaming framework for future defense development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current red-teaming research overlooks visual modality as an RCA attack surface in LVLMs, leaving gaps in mitigation strategies despite additional attack vectors introduced by vision integration.

Method: 1. Vision Guided Optimization: Fine-grained pixel-level optimization to create 'Output Recall' adversarial perturbations for repeating outputs. 2. Visual input perturbation injection to trigger unbounded generations. 3. Multi-Objective Parallel Losses for generating universal attack templates and resolving optimization conflicts in parallel attacks.

Result: RECALLED increases service response latency by 26√ó, with 20% higher GPU utilization and memory consumption, demonstrating its effectiveness in exploiting visual modality vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The study unveils critical security flaws in LVLMs via visual input RCAs and establishes a novel red-teaming framework to advance defense strategies against resource-based attacks.

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

### [9] [PyPitfall: Dependency Chaos and Software Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18075)
*Jacob Mahon,Chenxi Hou,Zhihao Yao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PyPitfall quantitatively analyzes vulnerable dependencies in PyPI, identifying 4,655 explicit vulnerable packages and 141,044 packages permitting vulnerable versions to raise supply chain security awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The official Python package repository PyPI lacks comprehensive analysis of vulnerable dependencies, risking widespread security issues through supply chain propagation.

Method: Analyzed dependency structures of 378,573 PyPI packages using quantitative methods to detect explicit and permitted vulnerable dependencies.

Result: 4,655 packages explicitly require known-vulnerable versions, while 141,044 packages allow vulnerable versions within specified range constraints.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant security risks in Python's supply chain, emphasizing the need for improved dependency management and security monitoring in PyPI.

Abstract: Python software development heavily relies on third-party packages. Direct
and transitive dependencies create a labyrinth of software supply chains. While
it is convenient to reuse code, vulnerabilities within these dependency chains
can propagate through dependencies, potentially affecting down-stream packages
and applications. PyPI, the official Python package repository, hosts many
packages and lacks a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of vulnerable
dependencies. This paper introduces PyPitfall, a quantitative analysis of
vulnerable dependencies across the PyPI ecosystem. We analyzed the dependency
structures of 378,573 PyPI packages and identified 4,655 packages that
explicitly require at least one known-vulnerable version and 141,044 packages
that permit vulnerable versions within specified ranges. By characterizing the
ecosystem-wide dependency landscape and the security impact of transitive
dependencies, we aim to raise awareness of Python software supply chain
security.

### [10] [An Improved ChaCha Algorithm Based on Quantum Random Number](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18157)
*Chao Liu,Shuai Zhao,Chenhao Jia,Gengran Hu,Tingting Cui*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: QRE-ChaCha enhances the security of the ChaCha cipher by integrating quantum random numbers into its round function and initial constants, improving resistance to differential attacks and cryptographic robustness while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ChaCha's widespread use in real-time communication faces threats from AI-assisted cryptanalysis and quantum computing advancements. Strengthening its security against both classical and emerging quantum attacks is critical for future-proofing cryptographic implementations.

Method: 1. XOR quantum random numbers with ChaCha's initial constants. 2. Periodically inject quantum random numbers into selected state words during odd rounds to augment diffusion. 3. Conduct automated SAT-based differential cryptanalysis for theoretical security evaluation. 4. Apply NIST and GM/T 0005-2021 statistical randomness tests to keystream sequences. 5. Measure encryption/decryption performance across varying file sizes.

Result: 1. Differential attack resistance improved compared to original ChaCha. 2. Keystream sequences pass rigorous NIST and GM/T 0005-2021 randomness tests (p > 0.001). 3. Encryption speed remains comparable to standard ChaCha (within 850 cycles/byte performance range). 4. SAT-based cryptanalysis confirms enhanced diffusion properties from random number injection.

Conclusion: QRE-ChaCha offers improved cryptographic security against both classical and quantum attack vectors through structured quantum random integration, while preserving the core performance advantages of ChaCha. The dual enhancement of attack resistance and randomness meets contemporary security requirements for real-time communication systems.

Abstract: Due to the merits of high efficiency and strong security against timing and
side-channel attacks, ChaCha has been widely applied in real-time communication
and data streaming scenarios. However, with the rapid development of
AI-assisted cryptanalysis and quantum computing technologies, there are serious
challenges to the secure implementation of ChaCha cipher. To further strengthen
the security of ChaCha cipher, we propose an improved variant based on quantum
random numbers, i.e., Quantum Random Number Enhanced ChaCha (QRE-ChaCha).
Specifically, the design XORs the initial constants with quantum random numbers
and periodically injects quantum random numbers into selected state words
during odd rounds to enhance diffusion. Compared with the original ChaCha, the
present variant shows stronger resistance to differential attacks and generates
a keystream with statistical randomness, thereby offering increased robustness
against both classical and quantum attacks. To evaluate the security and
performance of the present ChaCha, our analysis proceeds in three main parts.
Firstly, we analyze its theoretical security in terms of quantum randomness and
attack testing, and conduct differential cryptanalysis with an automated search
method based on the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Secondly, we subject
the keystream generated by the cipher to randomness tests using the NIST
statistical test suite and the GM/T 0005-2021 randomness testing standard.
Finally, we assess its encryption and decryption performance by measuring its
encryption speed on files of various sizes. According to the results, the
present ChaCha is significantly improved to resist differential attacks while
maintaining the high efficiency of the original ChaCha cipher, and its
keystream successfully passes statistical randomness tests using the NIST and
GM/T 0005-2021 standards, meeting cryptographic application requirements.

### [11] [Information Security Based on LLM Approaches: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18215)
*Chang Gong,Zhongwen Li,Xiaoqi Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper reviews applications of large language models (LLMs) in information security, highlighting their potential in malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and cryptocurrency optimization. While LLMs improve detection accuracy and reduce false alarms via neural networks and Transformer architectures, challenges in transparency, interpretability, and adaptability remain, necessitating structural improvements for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional information security protection methods struggle with complex, evolving threats, motivating the exploration of LLMs as an intelligent solution for enhanced security performance.

Method: Systematic review of LLM applications in five areas (malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, vulnerability detection, malicious code identification, cryptographic optimization) through analysis of technical foundations using neural networks and Transformer architecture.

Result: LLMs demonstrate improved security system detection accuracy and reduced false alarm rates across multiple domains while maintaining broad application potential in information security.

Conclusion: Though effective, LLM applications in security face challenges related to model transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, requiring further research into structural optimization and generalization improvement for intelligent, accurate security systems.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and
traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing
threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language
models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of
information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in
information security, systematically review its application progress in
malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, system vulnerability
detection, malicious code identification, and cryptographic algorithm
optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection
performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper
analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in
natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large
language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false
alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current
application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model
transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It

### [12] [Auto-SGCR: Automated Generation of Smart Grid Cyber Range Using IEC 61850 Standard Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18249)
*Muhammad M. Roomi,S. M. Suhail Hussain,Ee-Chien Chang,David M. Nicol,Daisuke Mashima*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes Auto-SGCR, an automated framework for generating smart grid cyber ranges using an XML-based modeling language (Smart Grid Modeling Language) and a toolchain for parsing and instantiation. It addresses limitations in configurability, accessibility, and cost by enabling reproducible, open-source experiments with large substation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital power grids are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, requiring iterative security testing. Existing cyber ranges are limited in configurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. Manual design is costly and requires extensive domain knowledge, creating a gap between academic research and real-world application.

Method: 1. Defined SG-ML, a human-/machine-friendly XML language for smart grid modeling, integrating IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. 2. Developed a toolchain to parse SG-ML models and automatically generate functional cyber ranges. 3. Open-sourced the framework and toolchain for accessibility.

Result: Demonstration of Auto-SGCR‚Äôs effectiveness via case studies with large-scale substation models. Open-sourced SG-ML examples and toolchain reduce barriers to adoption and enable reproducibility. Framework supports iterative testing and training.

Conclusion: Auto-SGCR overcomes challenges in smart grid cyber range design by automating model-driven generation, improving open accessibility, and reducing costs. The framework facilitates realistic testing, accelerates research, and bridges the gap between academia and production environments.

Abstract: Digitalization of power grids have made them increasingly susceptible to
cyber-attacks in the past decade. Iterative cybersecurity testing is
indispensable to counter emerging attack vectors and to ensure dependability of
critical infrastructure. Furthermore, these can be used to evaluate
cybersecurity configuration, effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures
against various attack vectors, as well as to train smart grid cybersecurity
experts defending the system. Enabling extensive experiments narrows the gap
between academic research and production environment. A high-fidelity cyber
range is vital as it is often infeasible to conduct such experiments and
training using production environment. However, the design and implementation
of cyber range requires extensive domain knowledge of physical and cyber aspect
of the infrastructure. Furthermore, costs incurred for setup and maintenance of
cyber range are significant. Moreover, most existing smart grid cyber ranges
are designed as a one-off, proprietary system, and are limited in terms of
configurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. To address
these challenges, an automated Smart grid Cyber Range generation framework is
presented in this paper. Initially a human-/machine-friendly, XML-based
modeling language called Smart Grid Modeling Language was defined, which
incorporates IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. Subsequently, a
toolchain to parse SG-ML model files and automatically instantiate a functional
smart grid cyber range was developed. The developed SG-ML models can be easily
shared and/or modified to reproduce or customize for any cyber range. The
application of Auto-SGCR is demonstrated through case studies with large-scale
substation models. The toolchain along with example SG-ML models have been
open-sourced.

### [13] [LoRA-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks Against LoRA Fine-tuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18302)
*Delong Ran,Xinlei He,Tianshuo Cong,Anyu Wang,Qi Li,Xiaoyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that LoRA-fine-tuned language models are resistant to membership inference attacks (MIAs) due to their limited parameter tuning. It introduces LoRA-Leak, an evaluation framework demonstrating significant MIA risks (e.g., 0.775 AUC) in LoRA models through pre-trained model leakage, while identifying dropout and layer exclusion as effective defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIAs for fine-tuned models overlook the privacy risks amplified by the pre-training phase, creating a false sense of security in lightweight methods like LoRA.

Method: Developed LoRA-Leak, a framework containing fifteen MIAs (ten existing and five pre-trained model-optimized variants) for evaluating membership leakage. Applied it to three LLMs across three NLP tasks with various fine-tuning settings.

Result: LoRA-fine-tuned models exhibit high MIA susceptibility (0.775 AUC under conservative settings). Only two defenses - dropout and selective layer fine-tuning - effectively reduce risks without sacrificing utility.

Conclusion: The 'pre-trained and fine-tuned' architecture inherently increases MIA vulnerability via pre-trained model interactions. Specialized LLM providers must adopt mitigation strategies like dropout and layer exclusion to protect fine-tuning data privacy.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

*Shariq Murtuza*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Scout is a digital forensics framework leveraging large language models to prioritize and process evidence, reducing false positives from vast data volumes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid growth of powerful consumer-grade hardware increases digital evidence in investigations, creating a need for efficient tools to manage data overload and reduce false positives in forensic analysis.

Method: Scout uses foundational text-based large language models for textual evidence files (disk images, memory dumps, network packets) and multimodal models for multimedia files (audio, images, video, office documents) to perform preliminary evidence prioritization.

Result: Scout successfully identifies and prioritizes evidence files of interest to investigators by deploying text and multimodal models, streamlining the forensic analysis process.

Conclusion: Scout demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating LLMs into digital forensics, improving efficiency in evidence processing while addressing false positives through targeted prioritization for various file types.

Abstract: Recent technological advancements and the prevalence of technology in day to
day activities have caused a major increase in the likelihood of the
involvement of digital evidence in more and more legal investigations.
Consumer-grade hardware is growing more powerful, with expanding memory and
storage sizes and enhanced processor capabilities. Forensics investigators
often have to sift through gigabytes of data during an ongoing investigation
making the process tedious. Memory forensics, disk analysis all are well
supported by state of the art tools that significantly lower the effort
required to be put in by a forensic investigator by providing string searches,
analyzing images file etc. During the course of the investigation a lot of
false positives are identified that need to be lowered. This work presents
Scout, a digital forensics framework that performs preliminary evidence
processing and prioritizing using large language models. Scout deploys
foundational language models to identify relevant artifacts from a large number
of potential evidence files (disk images, captured network packets, memory
dumps etc.) which would have taken longer to get identified. Scout employs text
based large language models can easily process files with textual information.
For the forensic analysis of multimedia files like audio, image, video, office
documents etc. multimodal models are employed by Scout. Scout was able to
identify and realize the evidence file that were of potential interest for the
investigator.

*Hao Li,Lijun Li,Zhenghao Lu,Xianyi Wei,Rui Li,Jing Shao,Lei Sha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces LARF (Layer-Aware Representation Filtering) to detect and remove safety-degrading data samples during fine-tuning of aligned LLMs, mitigating safety alignment compromise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning aligned large language models (LLMs) for real-world applications risks safety degradation even with benign datasets, as these datasets may contain hidden malicious features that increase vulnerability to harmful instructions.

Method: LARF identifies safety-sensitive layers in pre-trained LLMs and uses their hidden representations to detect data samples in downstream tasks that introduce safety-degrading features during fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show LARF effectively detects hidden harmful features in seemingly benign datasets, and removing these samples significantly reduces safety alignment degradation in fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: LARF provides a novel framework for ensuring safety preservation during model fine-tuning by filtering dataset samples that negatively impact safety alignment, offering both theoretical insights and practical utility for secure model deployment.

Abstract: With rapid advancement and increasing accessibility of LLMs, fine-tuning
aligned models has become a critical step for adapting them to real-world
applications, which makes the safety of this fine-tuning process more important
than ever. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical challenge: even
when fine-tuning with seemingly benign downstream datasets, the safety of
aligned LLMs can be compromised, making them more susceptible to malicious
instructions. In this paper, we show that fine-tuning datasets often contain
samples with safety-degrading features that are not easily identifiable on the
surface. These samples can significantly degrade the safety alignment of LLMs
during fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose LARF, a
\textbf{L}ayer-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{F}iltering
method. This method identifies safety-sensitive layers within the LLM and
leverages their representations to detect which data samples in the
post-training dataset contain safety-degrading features. Experimental results
demonstrate that LARF can effectively identify benign data with
safety-degrading features. After removing such data, the safety alignment
degradation caused by fine-tuning is mitigated. Please see our code at

### [17] [How Software Engineers Engage with AI: A Pragmatic Process Model and Decision Framework Grounded in Industry Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17930)
*Vahid Garousi,Zafar Jafarov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pragmatic process model and a 2D decision framework to analyze AI-assisted software engineering practices, particularly focusing on how engineers navigate trust, refinement, and rejection of AI-generated code outputs through empirical studies in Turkey and Azerbaijan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of AI coding tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) has introduced new interactive workflows in SE, but systematic understanding of developers' decision-making patterns in AI-assisted contexts remains underdeveloped.

Method: Combined practitioner reports and direct observations from three industry settings to create a process model (including prompt design, inspection, fallback, and refinement) and a 2D decision framework evaluating effort-saving vs. output quality trade-offs.

Result: Illustrated concrete examples of AI usage in industry through the process model and decision framework, demonstrating mechanisms of human-AI collaboration in SE tasks.

Conclusion: Provides structured guidance for sustainable AI integration in SE by highlighting critical workflow components and decision-making criteria for maintaining quality while leveraging AI capabilities.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform Software
Engineering (SE) by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision support.
Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an
exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers
engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to
trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This
paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process
model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design,
inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that
could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output
quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three
industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how
engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured,
lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools
in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 11 automated tools across 9 reproducibility criteria to determine their effectiveness in enhancing scientific transparency, finding that combining tools often improves detection of reporting standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the reproducibility crisis by identifying gaps in checklist adherence and peer review, aiming to guide tool development to better support researchers and publishers in maintaining rigor.

Method: Conducted a systematic comparison of 11 automated tools measuring their ability to detect 9 rigor criteria from ScreenIT, analyzing performance across distinct criteria categories.

Result: Some criteria (e.g., open data detection) had dominant tools, while combined tool use exceeded single-tool performance for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Identified prioritization areas for tool improvement.

Conclusion: Provided actionable recommendations for tool developers to optimize effectiveness, emphasizing combination approaches and targeted improvements for specific criteria requirements.

Abstract: The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and
transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT
seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and
peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues,
there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different
rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools
across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some
criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed
a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other
cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination
of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas
where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally
useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders
in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data

### [19] [An Empirical Study of GenAI Adoption in Open-Source Game Development: Tools, Tasks, and Developer Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18029)
*Xiang Echo Chen,Wenhan Zhu,Guoshuai Albert Shi,Michael W. Godfrey*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study analyzes how generative AI (GenAI) is adopted in open-source game development through GitHub issue discussions, comparing its usage patterns, challenges, and integration practices with traditional AI (TradAI) and non-AI (NonAI) approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research has focused on traditional AI applications in games (e.g., agent control, procedural content), but there is limited empirical evidence on GenAI adoption in real-world open-source development contexts, particularly regarding its unique challenges and integration workflows.

Method: The authors 1) curate a dataset of open-source game repositories discussing AI-related topics on GitHub; 2) apply open card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of issues; and 3) annotate and compare issues across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI categories to identify patterns and challenges.

Result: The analysis reveals distinct tool preferences, task domains, and challenges associated with GenAI (e.g., dataset quality, creative iteration) versus TradAI (e.g., algorithm optimization) and NonAI (e.g., manual coding). GenAI shows growth potential but faces integration and evaluation barriers.

Conclusion: GenAI is increasingly influencing game development practices, particularly in content creation and simulation tasks. However, its adoption differs significantly from traditional AI approaches, requiring new workflows and validation methods for open-source game developers.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) have begun to reshape how
games are designed and developed, offering new tools for content creation,
gameplay simulation, and design ideation. While prior research has explored
traditional uses of AI in games, such as controlling agents or generating
procedural content. There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is
adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source
community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed,
adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue
discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges
associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving
traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI
differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns,
and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of
open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open
card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues,
labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative
analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how
GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.

*Sivana Hamer,Jacob Bowen,Md Nazmul Haque,Chris Madden,Laurie Williams*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper maps MITRE ATT&CK attack techniques to a proactive software supply chain risk management framework using four strategies, enabling organizations to identify task-based mitigations and align with existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for proactive risk management in software supply chains by linking specific tasks to MITRE ATT&CK attack techniques, enhancing organizational resilience against cyber threats.

Method: The authors applied four independent strategies to establish consensus-based mappings between MITRE ATT&CK attack techniques and P-SSCRM tasks, while also connecting these tasks to 10 industry and government frameworks.

Result: The resulting mapping demonstrates how MITRE ATT&CK attack techniques correspond to P-SSCRM tasks and establishes a bridge between P-SSCRM and other security frameworks, though specific validation metrics are not mentioned.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical tool for software organizations to integrate proactive supply chain risk mitigation strategies with MITRE ATT&CK, though implementation implications remain unspecified.

Abstract: The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (MITRE ATT&CK)
Attack Technique to Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework
(P-SSCRM) Task mapping described in this document helps software organizations
to determine how different tasks mitigate the attack techniques of software
supply chain attacks. The mapping was created through four independent
strategies to find agreed-upon mappings. Because each P-SSCRM task is mapped to
one or more tasks from the 10 frameworks, the mapping we provide is also a
mapping between MITRE ATT&CK and other prominent government and industry
frameworks.

### [21] [Factors Impacting Faculty Adoption of Project-Based Learning in Computing Education: a Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18039)
*Ahmad D. Suleiman,Yiming Tang,Daqing Hou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores factors influencing computing educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL), identifying barriers such as institutional support and project design challenges, while highlighting enablers like peer collaboration and professional development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PjBL is a valued student-centered approach, but inconsistent adoption among educators in computing curricula warrants investigation to address motivational, logistical, and institutional obstacles.

Method: A mixed-methods design: an online survey of 80 computing faculty with closed-ended questions (quantitative analysis) and open-ended responses (thematic analysis) to assess barriers, enablers, and resource needs for PjBL adoption.

Result: PjBL adoption is selective due to planning difficulties, inadequate institutional support, and project design challenges. Faculty benefit from peer collaboration, professional training, incentives, and leveraging research/industry projects for implementation success.

Conclusion: Systemic institutional support‚Äîincluding time, funding, and teaching assistants‚Äîis critical to enabling educators to experiment with and scale PjBL practices effectively in computing education.

Abstract: This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing
educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering
and computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,
PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical
thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,
faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient
institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,
designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This
research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources
that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data
from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising
closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,
along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative
data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses
underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,
its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and
managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of
institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty
are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer
collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In
addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing
from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings
underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to
experiment with and scale PjBL practices.

### [22] [An Empirical Study of Complexity, Heterogeneity, and Compliance of GitHub Actions Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18062)
*Edward Abrokwah,Taher A. Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study analyzes GitHub Actions (GHA) workflows in open-source projects to understand their alignment with best practices, identify complexity, and uncover language-specific pipeline design patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirical understanding of real-world GHA workflows is lacking, despite their widespread use and the importance of CI practices for software development efficiency and collaboration.

Method: The research uses a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++ repositories to identify complexities, recurring structuring patterns, compliance with best practices, and language-specific differences.

Result: Expected outcomes include insights into workflow simplicity/complexity, pattern recurrence, best practice adherence gaps, and programming language impacts on CI pipeline design.

Conclusion: The findings will inform improvements in CI documentation, tooling, and guidelines by revealing current practices and areas requiring simplification or enhanced support structures for effective CI engineering.

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) has evolved from a tooling strategy to a
fundamental mindset in modern CI engineering. It enables teams to develop,
test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services,
GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep
integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions.
Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best
practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how
open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows
might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI
practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity,
heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software
repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++
repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze
recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with
GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across
programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong
adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These
insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight
the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.

*Carol Wong,Mai Abe,Silvia De Benedictis,Marissa Halim,Anthony Peruma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a taxonomy for identifier name similarity in software projects to analyze its impact on code comprehension and collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poorly chosen identifier names increase cognitive load and hinder collaboration, while even readable names can cause misunderstandings when similar to others.

Method: An exploratory study was conducted to develop a taxonomy categorizing different forms of identifier name similarity.

Result: The paper presents preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity and provides an initial taxonomy for further research.

Conclusion: The taxonomy offers a framework for researchers to study effects of identifier similarity on code quality and collaboration, with potential for refinement and expansion.

Abstract: Identifier names, which comprise a significant portion of the codebase, are
the cornerstone of effective program comprehension. However, research has shown
that poorly chosen names can significantly increase cognitive load and hinder
collaboration. Even names that appear readable in isolation may lead to
misunderstandings in contexts when they closely resemble other names in either
structure or functionality. In this exploratory study, we present our
preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in
software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes
different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy
providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of
identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and
collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and
expansion of the taxonomy.

*Yujie Ma,Lili Quan,Xiaofei Xie,Qiang Hu,Jiongchi Yu,Yao Zhang,Sen Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first comprehensive dataset for analyzing LLM supply chain security, identifying 3,859 applications with deeply nested dependencies and 1,555 risk-related issues across models, datasets, and libraries to guide safer LLM system development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based systems rely on complex interconnected supply chains (models, datasets, libraries), but existing risk assessments focus narrowly on models/data, neglecting broader vulnerabilities and lacking systematic benchmarks for research.

Method: The researchers collected 3,859 real-world LLM applications, conducted interdependency analysis to map 109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, 9,862 libraries, and extracted dependency relationships (fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, library reliance). They also gathered 1,555 risk issues (including 1,229 for libraries) from public vulnerability databases.

Result: Empirical analysis revealed deeply nested application dependencies (e.g., 784-1123 layers) and numerous known vulnerabilities, including 325 in models and 1,229 in libraries. The dataset systematically demonstrates supply chain-wide security risks in LLM ecosystems.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the critical need for security analysis beyond model/data layers in LLM supply chains, offering practical recommendations for developers/researchers to enhance system trustworthiness through supply chain transparency and proactive risk mitigation.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment
of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate,
understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is
increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on
interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party
libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly
focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities.
While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there
remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.
  To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for
analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859
real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying
109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model
fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's
structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for
applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from
public vulnerability databases.
  Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks.
Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and
significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for
comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to
guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled
systems.

*Le Deng,Zhonghao Jiang,Jialun Cao,Michael Pradel,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in natural language (NL)-driven no-code development tasks. It highlights LLMs' current limitations (15.79% success rate) in handling cross-file edits, codebase understanding, and tool calling despite high token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the research gap in evaluating LLMs' ability to perform real-world NL-driven no-code development by creating a standardized challenge benchmark. This supports efforts to improve developer productivity and democratize software creation via natural language interfaces.

Method: 1) Constructed NoCode-bench with 634 feature-update tasks across 10 real-world projects (114k code edits) 2) Paired documentation updates with code implementations 3) Used developer-written tests to validate completions 4) Created a verified subset of 114 human-checked instances

Result: Best-performing LLMs achieved 15.79% task success rate despite high token consumption, with primary failure modes including cross-file editing challenges (38% of failures), codebase understanding issues (27%), and improper tool calls (22%). Human evaluation confirms low-quality outputs for unverified instances.

Conclusion: Current LLM capabilities remain insufficient for reliable NL-driven no-code development due to limitations in cross-file reasoning, context understanding, and tool integration. The benchmark identifies specific areas for improvement and provides a foundation for advancing this paradigm.

Abstract: Natural language-driven no-code development allows users to specify software
functionality using natural language (NL) instead of editing source code,
promising increased productivity and democratized development. Large language
models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context,
software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work
introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world
NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects
and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding
code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of
114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures
reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the
best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges
in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings
indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development.
NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.

TL;DR: SMECS simplifies metadata creation for research software by automatically extracting metadata from online repositories (like GitHub) and offering an interactive curation interface, improving FAIR compliance and reducing researcher effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research software metadata creation is resource-intensive, hindering adoption of FAIR principles. Automated extraction with efficient curation workflows are needed to enable findability and reusability of research software.

Method: Developed SMECS to integrate metadata extraction from existing sources (e.g., GitHub) with a user-friendly interactive interface for curation, followed by usability experiments to evaluate its effectiveness.

Result: Usability experiments confirmed SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience and successfully simplifies the metadata creation process for research software through automated extraction and interactive refinement.

Conclusion: SMECS addresses the barrier of manual metadata creation for research software, promoting FAIRification by combining automated extraction with intuitive curation tools, ultimately enhancing software findability, reusability, and long-term preservation.

Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in adopting the FAIR principles for research
software and enables findability and reusability. However, creating
high-quality metadata can be resource-intensive for researchers and research
software engineers. To address this challenge, we developed the Software
Metadata Extraction and Curation Software (SMECS) which integrates the
extraction of metadata from existing sources together with a user-friendly
interface for metadata curation. SMECS extracts metadata from online
repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an
interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The
usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed
that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the
FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A GenAI-powered method for automotive software development, focusing on ADAS. Uses LLMs and MDE to convert requirements into test scenarios (Python) and ADAS implementations (C++), with RAG enhancing regulatory compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional development processes for automotive systems are time-consuming and error-prone, requiring efficient solutions for ADAS compliance and re-engineering cycles.

Method: LLMs generate Ecore metamodels, XMI instances, OCL constraints, and code;
MDE ensures requirement-consistency checks;
RAG improves test scenario generation from regulation documents.

Result: Automation of simulation code (Python) and target code (C++);
Reduced development and testing time;
Shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles using AI.

Conclusion: GenAI integration accelerates ADAS development and testing while ensuring regulatory compliance through requirements-driven model and code generation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

### [28] [An Empirical Study on Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robot (EAIR) Software Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18267)
*Zeqin Liao,Zibin Zheng,Peifan Reng,Henglong Liang,Zixu Gao,Zhixiang Chen,Wei Li,Yuhong Nan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic study of 885 EAIR system bugs, identifying 8 EAIR-specific symptoms, 8 causes, and a causal-module mapping to enhance bug prediction and repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of understanding about EAIR system bugs impeded the development of effective practices to address them, necessitating a comprehensive investigation to guide future research.

Method: The authors analyzed 885 bugs from 80 EAIR system projects, categorizing them into 18 underlying causes, 15 distinct symptoms, and 13 affected modules through rigorous classification.

Result: Novel findings include EAIR-specific symptoms (8 total) with severe functional/physical impacts, EAIR-specific causes (8) linked to AI agent reasoning, and a module-cause mapping for efficient diagnostic targeting.

Conclusion: The study establishes a foundation for EAIR bug mitigation by documenting system-specific failure patterns, root causes in AI decision-making, and actionable insights for repair research, but does not state current maturity of the proposed techniques.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly
evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is
fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth
understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the
development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs.
  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR
system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their
symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes
considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15
distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new
interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research
on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified
symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is
characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards.
Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the
majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and
decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction,
detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and
the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to
focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.

### [29] [Scheduzz: Constraint-based Fuzz Driver Generation with Dual Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18289)
*Yan Li,Wenzhang Yang,Yuekun Wang,Jian Gao,Shaohua Wang,Yinxing Xue,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Scheduzz is an LLM-based library fuzzing technique with a dual scheduling framework that improves resource utilization and achieves higher coverage, discovering 33 new bugs including 3 with CVEs in 33 real-world libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated fuzz driver generation techniques lack adherence to library usage conventions (e.g., resource closure) and unconditionally execute all drivers, leading to wasted resources, low coverage, and false positives.

Method: Uses LLMs to extract library usage constraints and implements a dual scheduling framework treating driver generation as an online optimization problem. Combines API constraint analysis with dynamic scheduling of fuzz drivers for execution or suspension.

Result: Outperformed baseline tools: 1.62x/1.50x/1.89x coverage improvement over CKGFuzzer/Promptfuzz/OSS-Fuzz respectively. Reduced overhead compared to existing methods and discovered 33 unreported bugs (3 with CVEs) in well-tested libraries.

Conclusion: Scheduzz addresses critical limitations of existing library fuzzing approaches by combining LLM-driven usage modeling with dual scheduling optimization, significantly improving efficiency, coverage, and real-world bug-finding capabilities.

Abstract: Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and
craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many
techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However,
they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to
proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after
being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques
unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers
that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and
generating false positive bug reports.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing
technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs
to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination
constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling
framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz
drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing
campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,
multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while
simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or
suspension.
  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared
to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead
and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and
1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer,
Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition,
Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries,
3 of which have been assigned CVEs.

### [30] [YATE: The Role of Test Repair in LLM-Based Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18316)
*Michael Konstantinou,Renzo Degiovanni,Jie M. Zhang,Mark Harman,Mike Papadakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces YATE, a method combining rule-based static analysis and re-prompting to repair incorrect tests generated by LLMs, achieving higher code coverage and mutant detection than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated unit tests often contain syntactic/semantic errors, which when fixed, can improve testing efficacy and serve as test generation seeds.

Method: YATE repairs incorrect tests using rule-based static analysis (to detect/directly fix errors) and re-prompting (to refine test generation via feedback).

Result: YATE improves line coverage by 32.06%, mutant detection by 21.77%, and outperforms four other LLM-based methods with 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage, and 20% more dead mutants.

Conclusion: YATE effectively addresses LLM test generation errors through a cost-efficient hybrid approach, delivering substantial improvements in testing metrics.

Abstract: Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to
produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many
incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such
incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed
opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing
value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and
indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we
propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through
a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this
simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that
it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and
kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE
with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and
COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code.
YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20%
more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).

### [31] [Gotta catch 'em all! Towards File Localisation from Issues at Large](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18319)
*Jesse Maarleveld,Jiapan Guo,Daniel Feitosa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data pipeline for issue file localisation, evaluates baseline methods using information retrieval, and investigates biases from bug-specific heuristics. It highlights the need for general-purpose models as bug-targeted approaches fail for diverse issues, with performance differences across issue types and project-dependent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on file localisation is limited to bugs or specific issue types, but the authors aim to address all issue types broadly without selection methods to better reflect real-world scenarios and identify gaps in current approaches.

Method: The paper develops a customizable data pipeline for creating issue-localisation datasets (handling branching/merging), applies traditional IR methods as a baseline, and conducts statistical analysis to assess biases present in prior bug-localisation studies.

Result: Bug-specific methods underperform on general issues; small yet statistically significant performance variations exist between issue types; identifiers have minimal impact for most issues; results strongly depend on the project, suggesting the need for adaptable solutions.

Conclusion: The findings stress the necessity of general-purpose file localisation models and project-specific refinement. The proposed pipeline and analysis provide a framework for future research in handling diverse software issues beyond bugs.

Abstract: Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files
requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to
develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are
starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing
research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other
selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part
of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without
any specific selection.
  In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file
localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging
practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file
localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches.
Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases
known in the bug localisation community on our dataset.
  Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform
poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general
purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically
significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally,
we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for
most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the
development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.

### [32] [FMI Meets SystemC: A Framework for Cross-Tool Virtual Prototyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18339)
*Nils Bosbach,Meik Schmidt,Lukas J√ºnger,Matthias Berthold,Rainer Leupers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an FMI-supported framework for SystemC-based Virtual Platforms, enabling cross-tool co-simulation for realistic software testing without physical hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern systems require integrated testing and virtual prototyping across tools/hardware. SystemC TLM-based VPs lack native FMI compatibility, limiting co-simulation capabilities.

Method: Developed a framework mapping FMI interfaces to SystemC event queues with time synchronization, demonstrated through a temperature sensor case study bridging external tools and VP models.

Result: Successful FMI integration enabled unmodified software execution with realistic environmental inputs (temperature, velocity) from external models, reducing requirements for physical hardware access.

Conclusion: The framework enhances VPs in cross-tool co-simulation flows, enabling ISO 26262-like certifications earlier by pre-testing software with virtual environmental stimuli.

Abstract: As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual
prototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed
to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the
environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface
(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.
  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a
System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software
from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software
without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the
so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized
framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and
concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks
native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation
environments.
  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with
SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a
simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature
values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified
target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data
such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,
extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready
and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,
certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.

### [33] [Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476)
*Busra Icoz,Goksel Biricik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid approach combining symbolic reasoning and LLMs to improve automated code review accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual code reviews are subjective and inefficient, while LLMs lack necessary logical reasoning for thorough code evaluation.

Method: Hybrid integration of symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs (CodeT5, CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT) using CodexGlue dataset for comparison.

Result: Demonstrated enhanced accuracy and efficiency in automated code review through this hybrid framework.

Conclusion: Symbolic reasoning combined with LLMs offers a promising solution to advance automated code review capabilities.

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

### [34] [A Deep Dive into Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Code Completion: Experience on WeChat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18515)
*Zezhou Yang,Ting Peng,Cuiyun Gao,Chaozheng Wang,Hailiang Huang,Yuetang Deng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper empirically evaluates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method for code completion in WeChat's closed-source codebase, comparing lexical and semantic retrieval techniques across 26 open-source LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG research focuses on open-source codebases, but industrial closed-source systems face distribution shifts challenging model effectiveness. This study addresses this gap using real-world WeChat data.

Method: Evaluated two RAG types (identifier-based and similarity-based) with 26 open-source LLMs (0.5B-671B parameters). Used BM25 for lexical retrieval and GTE-Qwen for semantic retrieval, analyzing performance across 1,669 internal repositories and validating through developer surveys.

Result: Similarity-based RAG outperformed identifier-based methods. BM25 and GTE-Qwen showed best performance among retrieval techniques, and their combination achieved optimal results. Developer surveys confirmed practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: Combined lexical and semantic retrieval significantly enhances RAG for industrial code completion tasks, offering complementary benefits to address distribution shifts in closed-source codebases.

Abstract: Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances
developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid
advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to
enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant
context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and
benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and
closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To
mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance
of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase
of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we
extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG
and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B
parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval
techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.
Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both
RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with
similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of
similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where
BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior
performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval
techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.
Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of
RAG methods in real-world development environments.
