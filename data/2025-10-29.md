### [2] [SAND: A Self-supervised and Adaptive NAS-Driven Framework for Hardware Trojan Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23643)
*Zhixin Pan,Ziyu Shu,Linh Nguyen,Amberbir Alemayoh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SAND is a self-supervised and adaptive NAS-driven framework for efficient Hardware Trojan detection, showing improved accuracy and adaptability over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The globalized semiconductor supply chain has made Hardware Trojans a security threat, and current ML-based detection methods face issues with ad hoc feature selection and lack of adaptability.

Method: SAND combines self-supervised learning for automated feature extraction and neural architecture search to dynamically optimize the classifier, allowing adaptation to new benchmarks with minimal tuning.

Result: SAND outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 18.3% in detection accuracy, shows high resilience against evasive Trojans, and exhibits strong generalization.

Conclusion: SAND provides an efficient, adaptive solution to HT detection by leveraging SSL and NAS, addressing current limitations in feature selection and adaptability.

Abstract: The globalized semiconductor supply chain has made Hardware Trojans (HT) a
significant security threat to embedded systems, necessitating the design of
efficient and adaptable detection mechanisms. Despite promising machine
learning-based HT detection techniques in the literature, they suffer from ad
hoc feature selection and the lack of adaptivity, all of which hinder their
effectiveness across diverse HT attacks. In this paper, we propose SAND, a
selfsupervised and adaptive NAS-driven framework for efficient HT detection.
Specifically, this paper makes three key contributions. (1) We leverage
self-supervised learning (SSL) to enable automated feature extraction,
eliminating the dependency on manually engineered features. (2) SAND integrates
neural architecture search (NAS) to dynamically optimize the downstream
classifier, allowing for seamless adaptation to unseen benchmarks with minimal
fine-tuning. (3) Experimental results show that SAND achieves a significant
improvement in detection accuracy (up to 18.3%) over state-of-the-art methods,
exhibits high resilience against evasive Trojans, and demonstrates strong
generalization.

Motivation: Motivation

Method: Method

Result: Result

Conclusion: Conclusion

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized interface
enabling seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external
data sources and tools. While MCP significantly reduces development complexity
and enhances agent capabilities, its openness and extensibility introduce
critical security vulnerabilities that threaten system trustworthiness and user
data protection. This paper systematically analyzes the security landscape of
MCP-based systems, identifying three principal threat categories: (1) agent
hijacking attacks stemming from protocol design deficiencies; (2) traditional
web vulnerabilities in MCP servers; and (3) supply chain security. To address
these challenges, we comprehensively survey existing defense strategies,
examining both proactive server-side scanning approaches, ranging from layered
detection pipelines and agentic auditing frameworks to zero-trust registry
systems, and runtime interaction monitoring solutions that provide continuous
oversight and policy enforcement. Our analysis reveals that MCP security
fundamentally represents a paradigm shift where the attack surface extends from
traditional code execution to semantic interpretation of natural language
metadata, necessitating novel defense mechanisms tailored to this unique threat
model.

### [4] [QueryIPI: Query-agnostic Indirect Prompt Injection on Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23675)
*Yuchong Xie,Zesen Liu,Mingyu Luo,Zhixiang Zhang,Kaikai Zhang,Zongjie Li,Ping Chen,Shuai Wang,Dongdong She*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: QueryIPI: Query-Agnostic Indirect Prompt Injection for Improved Attack Success Rate in Coding Agents


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IPI methods for coding agents are query-specific, leading to low and unstable attack success rates. This paper addresses more severe, query-agnostic threats that are resilient to input variations.

Method: Through exploiting the leakage of the agent's internal prompt, the paper develops QueryIPI, which iteratively refines malicious tool descriptions using an internal-prompt-guided approach to transform attacks into white-box optimization problems.

Result: QueryIPI achieves up to 87% attack success rates across five simulated agents and demonstrates practical transferability of the malicious tool descriptions to real-world systems.

Conclusion: The study reveals a substantial security vulnerability in modern coding agents related to internal prompt leakage and shows that adversarial tool descriptions crafted through this method affect real-world systems, pointing to the urgency for improved security measures.

Abstract: Modern coding agents integrated into IDEs combine powerful tools and
system-level actions, exposing a high-stakes attack surface. Existing Indirect
Prompt Injection (IPI) studies focus mainly on query-specific behaviors,
leading to unstable attacks with lower success rates. We identify a more
severe, query-agnostic threat that remains effective across diverse user
inputs. This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability:
leakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the attack into a
constrained white-box optimization problem. We present QueryIPI, the first
query-agnostic IPI method for coding agents. QueryIPI refines malicious tool
descriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked
internal prompt. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI
achieves up to 87 percent success, outperforming baselines, and the generated
malicious descriptions also transfer to real-world systems, highlighting a
practical security risk to modern LLM-based coding agents.

### [5] [EthVault: A Secure and Resource-Conscious FPGA-Based Ethereum Cold Wallet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23847)
*Joel Poncha Lemayian,Ghyslain Gagnon,Kaiwen Zhang,Pascal Giard*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces EthVault, a hardware-based Ethereum cold wallet architecture to enhance security against software-based threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software-based cryptocurrency wallets, whether hot or cold, are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, which can compromise private keys used for generating public keys and authorizing transactions.

Method: The paper proposes EthVault, a hardware architecture for Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallets, with hardware implementations of key algorithms like ECC and child key derivation. This design is optimized for low resource usage on an FPGA.

Result: FPGA implementation results showed that the ECC architecture displays uniform execution behavior across varying inputs. The complete design used only 27% of LUTs, 7% of registers, and 6% of RAM blocks on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA, confirming its feasibility for compact, secure cold wallets.

Conclusion: EthVault offers a secure, hardware-based solution to the vulnerabilities of software-only cryptocurrency wallets, minimizing resource consumption while meeting the demand for small, portable devices.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchain networks safeguard digital assets using
cryptographic keys, with wallets playing a critical role in generating,
storing, and managing these keys. Wallets, typically categorized as hot and
cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are
generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers.
Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing
perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as
ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize
transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first
hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet,
featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation.
Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is
proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a
fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design
minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable
cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of
the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior
across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6%
of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+
FPGA.

### [6] [PRO: Enabling Precise and Robust Text Watermark for Open-Source LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23891)
*Jiaqi Xue,Yifei Zhao,Mansour Al Ghanim,Shangqian Gao,Ruimin Sun,Qian Lou,Mengxin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PRO is a new text watermarking method for open-source LLMs that improves detectability and resilience through joint training and regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LLMs lack practical methods to verify text origin, and existing watermarking methods face challenges with detectability and fragility to modifications.

Method: PRO jointly trains a watermark policy with the LLM and uses a regularization term to simulate downstream perturbations, enhancing both learning and robustness.

Result: PRO significantly improves watermark detectability and resilience to model modifications in open-source LLMs like LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, and Phi-2.

Conclusion: PRO provides an effective solution for watermarking open-source LLMs with enhanced detectability and robustness to modifications.

Abstract: Text watermarking for large language models (LLMs) enables model owners to
verify text origin and protect intellectual property. While watermarking
methods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to
open-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the
decoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means
to verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in
embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability.
A promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an
open one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between
learned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications
such as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose
PRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO
jointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that
are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria.
A regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes
degradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits.
Experiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO
substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model
modifications.

*Daniel Spokoyny,Nikolai Vogler,Xin Gao,Tianyi Zheng,Yufei Weng,Jonghyun Park,Jiajun Jiao,Geoffrey M. Voelker,Stefan Savage,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHATTERBOX, an LLM-based system for automated long-term engagement with online scammers to facilitate large-scale investigations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pig butchering scams build trust over time and are hard to investigate at scale due to their conversational nature, leading to significant financial losses.

Method: Developing CH chatterbox, an LLM-based system automating long-term engagement with scammers by attracting attempts, convincingly interacting, and completing workflow milestones.

Result: CHATTERBOX enables automated, large-scale investigation into tactics used by online scammers over extended periods.

Conclusion: LLM-based automation can effectively support investigations into long-term conversational online scams, reducing human effort and enabling scalable analysis.

Abstract: Pig butchering, and similar interactive online scams, lower their victims'
defenses by building trust over extended periods of conversation - sometimes
weeks or months. They have become increasingly public losses (at least $75B by
one recent study). However, because of their long-term conversational nature,
they are extremely challenging to investigate at scale. In this paper, we
describe the motivation, design, implementation, and experience with
CHATTERBOX, an LLM-based system that automates long-term engagement with online
scammers, making large-scale investigations of their tactics possible. We
describe the techniques we have developed to attract scam attempts, the system
and LLM-engineering required to convincingly engage with scammers, and the
necessary capabilities required to satisfy or evade "milestones" in scammers'
workflow.

### [8] [Scalable GPU-Based Integrity Verification for Large Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23938)
*Marcin Spoczynski,Marcela S. Melara*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A security framework enhances distributed machine learning by aligning integrity verification with GPU execution and reducing overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional security verification methods for ML do not align with the GPU-centric execution of large models, causing inefficiencies and architectural mismatches.

Method: The authors integrate integrity verification directly into GPU operations using native hardware components, thereby leveraging the same high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing as ML workloads.

Result: The framework reduces verification overhead and enables consistent integrity checks across different GPU platforms and large models exceeding 100GB.

Conclusion: This GPU-native security framework provides performance improvements and scalability for large-scale ML systems while supporting future secure communication with TEEs.

Abstract: We present a security framework that strengthens distributed machine learning
by standardizing integrity protections across CPU and GPU platforms and
significantly reducing verification overheads. Our approach co-locates
integrity verification directly with large ML model execution on GPU
accelerators, resolving the fundamental mismatch between how large ML workloads
typically run (primarily on GPUs) and how security verifications traditionally
operate (on separate CPU-based processes), delivering both immediate
performance benefits and long-term architectural consistency. By performing
cryptographic operations natively on GPUs using dedicated compute units (e.g.,
Intel Arc's XMX units, NVIDIA's Tensor Cores), our solution eliminates the
potential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional CPU-based
verification systems when dealing with large models. This approach leverages
the same GPU-based high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives
that power ML workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model
execution even for massive models exceeding 100GB. This framework establishes a
common integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across
different GPU vendors and hardware configurations. By anticipating future
capabilities for creating secure channels between trusted execution
environments and GPU accelerators, we provide a hardware-agnostic foundation
that enterprise teams can deploy regardless of their underlying CPU and GPU
infrastructures.

*Austin Shouli,Yulia Bobkova,Ajay Kumar Shrestha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores how smart devices secretly collect private data, especially affecting youth privacy. Using PRISMA methodology, it introduces the SCOUR framework for analyzing privacy issues and proposes strategies for improving safeguards. Key findings highlight risks from smart toys and gadgets, emphasizing the need for better transparency and policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart devices often covertly capture private data, creating risks for youth privacy. As children become more aware of data breaches, balancing privacy and utility is essential to protect them. This paper aims to address these concerns and guide future policy and technical measures.

Method: The study conducts a systematic literature review following the PRISMA methodology. It synthesizes findings using the SCOUR framework, which includes aspects like surveillance mechanisms, operational data flow, and technical safeguards. The analysis covers data capture methods, storage, sharing practices, and mitigation strategies.

Result: Findings indicate that smart devices, particularly smart toys and voice-activated gadgets, are capturing private conversations without clear transparency. Unethical data collection and storage practices are prevalent, reinforcing the need for improved regulatory and technical safeguards. The review also highlights existing research gaps and suggests future directions.

Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of developing stronger policies and more transparent practices in smart device data collection, specifically for youth. It provides actionable insights into mitigating privacy risks and encourages further exploration of the subject, ensuring both technological utility and ethical responsibility.

Abstract: This paper investigates how smart devices covertly capture private
conversations and discusses in more in-depth the implications of this for youth
privacy. Using a structured review guided by the PRISMA methodology, the
analysis focuses on privacy concerns, data capture methods, data storage and
sharing practices, and proposed technical mitigations. To structure and
synthesize findings, we introduce the SCOUR framework, encompassing
Surveillance mechanisms, Consent and awareness, Operational data flow, Usage
and exploitation, and Regulatory and technical safeguards. Findings reveal that
smart devices have been covertly capturing personal data, especially with smart
toys and voice-activated smart gadgets built for youth. These issues are
worsened by unclear data collection practices and insufficient transparency in
smart device applications. Balancing privacy and utility in smart devices is
crucial, as youth are becoming more aware of privacy breaches and value their
personal data more. Strategies to improve regulatory and technical safeguards
are also provided. The review identifies research gaps and suggests future
directions. The limitations of this literature review are also explained. The
findings have significant implications for policy development and the
transparency of data collection for smart devices.

Motivation: Pri... (truncated due to length)

Method: Th... (truncated due to length)

Result: Th... (truncated due to length)

Conclusion: Th... (truncated due to length)

Abstract: Traceable signatures (Kiayas et al., EUROCRYPT 2004) is an anonymous digital
signature system that extends the tracing power of the opening authority in
group signatures. There are many known constructions of traceable signatures,
but all are based on number-theoretic/pairing assumptions. For such reason,
they may not be secure in the presence of quantum computers. This work revisits
the notion of traceable signatures and presents a lattice-based construction
provably secure in the quantum random oracle model (QROM).

### [11] [Demystifying Cookie Sharing Risks in WebView-based Mobile App-in-app Ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24141)
*Miao Zhang,Shenao Wang,Guilin Zheng,Yanjie Zhao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel vulnerability, Cross Mini-program Cookie Sharing (CMCS), in mini-programs of popular super-apps due to shared web-view environments, allowing unauthorized data exchange and enabling collusion attacks. The authors developed MiCoScan, a static analysis tool, to detect these vulnerabilities, revealing significant security risks through large-scale analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mini-programs, while convenient, have introduced new security risks because of their shared web-view component. The paper aims to address the vulnerabilities that arise from this design, which can lead to serious data exchange issues among mini-programs.

Method: The researchers conducted an initial analysis of web-view mechanisms across four major platforms and discovered the CMCS vulnerability. They then developed MiCoScan, utilizing web-view context modeling and cross-web-view data flow analysis to detect instances of CMCS vulnerabilities in a large-scale study of mini-programs.

Result: The analysis revealed 45,448 clusters of mini-programs sharing web-view domains, 7,965 cases of privileged data transmission, and 9,877 mini-programs vulnerable to collusion attacks. This demonstrates the extensive presence and risk of CMCS vulnerabilities across the platforms studied.

Conclusion: The study concludes that CMCS vulnerabilities pose significant security threats to the mini-program ecosystem and emphasizes the need for stronger isolation mechanisms to mitigate these risks.

Abstract: Mini-programs, an emerging mobile application paradigm within super-apps,
offer a seamless and installation-free experience. However, the adoption of the
web-view component has disrupted their isolation mechanisms, exposing new
attack surfaces and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel
vulnerability called Cross Mini-program Cookie Sharing (CMCS), which arises
from the shared web-view environment across mini-programs. This vulnerability
allows unauthorized data exchange across mini-programs by enabling one
mini-program to access cookies set by another within the same web-view context,
violating isolation principles. As a preliminary step, we analyzed the web-view
mechanisms of four major platforms, including WeChat, AliPay, TikTok, and
Baidu, and found that all of them are affected by CMCS vulnerabilities.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the collusion attack enabled by CMCS, where
privileged mini-programs exfiltrate sensitive user data via cookies accessible
to unprivileged mini-programs. To measure the impact of collusion attacks
enabled by CMCS vulnerabilities in the wild, we developed MiCoScan, a static
analysis tool that detects mini-programs affected by CMCS vulnerabilities.
MiCoScan employs web-view context modeling to identify clusters of
mini-programs sharing the same web-view domain and cross-webview data flow
analysis to detect sensitive data transmissions to/from web-views. Using
MiCoScan, we conducted a large-scale analysis of 351,483 mini-programs,
identifying 45,448 clusters sharing web-view domains, 7,965 instances of
privileged data transmission, and 9,877 mini-programs vulnerable to collusion
attacks. Our findings highlight the widespread prevalence and significant
security risks posed by CMCS vulnerabilities, underscoring the urgent need for
improved isolation mechanisms in mini-program ecosystems.

### [12] [Cybersecurity AI Benchmark (CAIBench): A Meta-Benchmark for Evaluating Cybersecurity AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24317)
*María Sanz-Gómez,Víctor Mayoral-Vilches,Francesco Balassone,Luis Javier Navarrete-Lozano,Cristóbal R. J. Veas Chavez,Maite del Mundo de Torres*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAIBench, a benchmark framework for evaluating AI models in cybersecurity, highlighting the gap between knowledge and applied skills in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on isolated skills, neglecting integrated performance and real-world labor relevance in cybersecurity domains.

Method: CAIBench is a modular meta-benchmark framework encompassing five evaluation categories, including CTFs, knowledge tests, and privacy assessments. It introduces novel components like RCTF2 and CyberPII-Bench.

Result: Leading AI models achieve 70% on knowledge metrics but show significant drop to 20-40% in A&D scenarios and 22% in robotic targets. Proper framework and model alignment boosts performance by 2.6x in A&D CTFs.

Conclusion: CAIBench reveals a critical knowledge-capability divide in AI for cybersecurity. The framework is a step toward assessing labor-relevance, with results showing high variance in complex adversarial settings.

Abstract: Cybersecurity spans multiple interconnected domains, complicating the
development of meaningful, labor-relevant benchmarks. Existing benchmarks
assess isolated skills rather than integrated performance. We find that
pre-trained knowledge of cybersecurity in LLMs does not imply attack and
defense abilities, revealing a gap between knowledge and capability. To address
this limitation, we present the Cybersecurity AI Benchmark (CAIBench), a
modular meta-benchmark framework that allows evaluating LLM models and agents
across offensive and defensive cybersecurity domains, taking a step towards
meaningfully measuring their labor-relevance. CAIBench integrates five
evaluation categories, covering over 10,000 instances: Jeopardy-style CTFs,
Attack and Defense CTFs, Cyber Range exercises, knowledge benchmarks, and
privacy assessments. Key novel contributions include systematic simultaneous
offensive-defensive evaluation, robotics-focused cybersecurity challenges
(RCTF2), and privacy-preserving performance assessment (CyberPII-Bench).
Evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals saturation on security
knowledge metrics (~70\% success) but substantial degradation in multi-step
adversarial (A\&D) scenarios (20-40\% success), or worse in robotic targets
(22\% success). The combination of framework scaffolding and LLM model choice
significantly impacts performance; we find that proper matches improve up to
2.6$\times$ variance in Attack and Defense CTFs. These results demonstrate a
pronounced gap between conceptual knowledge and adaptive capability,
emphasizing the need for a meta-benchmark.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Though playing an essential role in smart home systems, smart speakers are
vulnerable to voice spoofing attacks. Passive liveness detection, which
utilizes only the collected audio rather than the deployed sensors to
distinguish between live-human and replayed voices, has drawn increasing
attention. However, it faces the challenge of performance degradation under the
different environmental factors as well as the strict requirement of the fixed
user gestures.
  In this study, we propose a novel liveness feature, array fingerprint, which
utilizes the microphone array inherently adopted by the smart speaker to
determine the identity of collected audios. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that by leveraging the circular layout of microphones, compared
with existing schemes, array fingerprint achieves a more robust performance
under the environmental change and user's movement. Then, to leverage such a
fingerprint, we propose ARRAYID, a lightweight passive detection scheme, and
elaborate a series of features working together with array fingerprint. Our
evaluation on the dataset containing 32,780 audio samples and 14 spoofing
devices shows that ARRAYID achieves an accuracy of 99.84%, which is superior to
existing passive liveness detection schemes.

### [14] [Uncovering Gaps Between RFC Updates and TCP/IP Implementations: LLM-Facilitated Differential Checks on Intermediate Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24408)
*Yifan Wu,Xuewei Feng,Yuxiang Yang,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents an automated analysis framework using LLM and differential models to detect inconsistencies between TCP/IP protocol stack code and RFC standards, addressing security vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual and rule-based methods for detecting inconsistencies in protocol stack implementations are insufficient as RFC documents evolve rapidly and protocol stack complexity increases, leading to potential security issues.

Method: The proposed framework leverages large language models (LLM) and differential models to analyze the iterative relationship of protocols and RFC updates, enabling incremental code analysis across different kernel versions for automated detection and vulnerability assessment.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework in identifying vulnerabilities caused by RFC code inconsistencies, with practical validation and analysis.

Conclusion: An automated, scalable solution is essential for managing inconsistencies between evolving RFC standards and protocol implementations, and the presented framework offers a robust approach to address this challenge.

Abstract: As the core of the Internet infrastructure, the TCP/IP protocol stack
undertakes the task of network data transmission. However, due to the
complexity of the protocol and the uncertainty of cross-layer interaction,
there are often inconsistencies between the implementation of the protocol
stack code and the RFC standard. This inconsistency may not only lead to
differences in protocol functions but also cause serious security
vulnerabilities. At present, with the continuous expansion of protocol stack
functions and the rapid iteration of RFC documents, it is increasingly
important to detect and fix these inconsistencies. With the rise of large
language models, researchers have begun to explore how to extract protocol
specifications from RFC documents through these models, including protocol
stack modeling, state machine extraction, text ambiguity analysis, and other
related content. However, existing methods rely on predefined patterns or
rule-based approaches that fail to generalize across different protocol
specifications. Automated and scalable detection of these inconsistencies
remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an automated
analysis framework based on LLM and differential models. By modeling the
iterative relationship of the protocol and based on the iterative update
relationship of the RFC standard, we perform incremental code function analysis
on different versions of kernel code implementations to automatically perform
code detection and vulnerability analysis. We conduct extensive evaluations to
validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in
identifying potential vulnerabilities caused by RFC code inconsistencies.

### [15] [Attack on a PUF-based Secure Binary Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24422)
*Bijeet Basak,Nupur Patil,Kurian Polachan,Srinivas Vivek*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the insecurity of a PUF-based method for protecting Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) against physical attacks, demonstrating a key recovery attack using differential cryptanalysis to reconstruct the PUF key and model parameters efficiently with 85% key recovery and 93% model classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the security of a recently proposed PUF-based scheme for securing BNNs on memristive crossbar arrays against theft attacks and to demonstrate its insecurity through a physical attack method.

Method: An attack method inspired by differential cryptanalysis that reconstructs the PUF key by observing changes in BNN model accuracy. This process involves measuring the impact on model performance when the PUF key bits are altered during inference and using these measurements to infer the original key.

Result: The PUF key recovery attack successfully recovers 85% of the PUF key and BNN model parameters. The attacked BNN produced 93% classification accuracy on the MNIST dataset compared to the original 96% accuracy, and the attack executed in a few minutes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the PUF-based security scheme for BNNs is vulnerable to efficient PUF-key recovery attacks. Differential cryptanalysis-based methods can reconstruct the PUF key and model without needing access to the complete model internals or the device containing the BNN.

Abstract: Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) deployed on memristive crossbar arrays
provide energy-efficient solutions for edge computing but are susceptible to
physical attacks due to memristor nonvolatility. Recently, Rajendran et al.
(IEEE Embedded Systems Letter 2025) proposed a Physical Unclonable Function
(PUF)-based scheme to secure BNNs against theft attacks. Specifically, the
weight and bias matrices of the BNN layers were secured by swapping columns
based on device's PUF key bits.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that this scheme to secure BNNs is vulnerable
to PUF-key recovery attack. As a consequence of our attack, we recover the
secret weight and bias matrices of the BNN. Our approach is motivated by
differential cryptanalysis and reconstructs the PUF key bit-by-bit by observing
the change in model accuracy, and eventually recovering the BNN model
parameters. Evaluated on a BNN trained on the MNIST dataset, our attack could
recover 85% of the PUF key, and recover the BNN model up to 93% classification
accuracy compared to the original model's 96% accuracy. Our attack is very
efficient and it takes a couple of minutes to recovery the PUF key and the
model parameters.

*Tejaswini Bollikonda*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic framework for cloud-native homomorphic encryption (HE) workflows to enhance privacy-preserving machine learning inference, achieving 3.2x faster inference and 40% less memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring data confidentiality in ML inference on public clouds is challenging due to security risks. Homomorphic encryption (HE) allows secure computation on encrypted data but faces issues with scalability, complexity, and performance in cloud environments.

Method: The framework integrates containerized HE modules with Kubernetes orchestration for elastic scaling and parallel computation. It also employs optimization techniques such as ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus adjustment, and operator fusion to improve efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show the framework provides 3.2 times faster inference and 40% lower memory consumption compared to traditional HE setups in cloud-native pipelines.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for deploying secure and efficient ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) under zero-trust cloud conditions, addressing the scalability and performance limitations of HE.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud
infrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a
significant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a
compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data,
allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs.
However, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines
remains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity,
and model compatibility issues.
  This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of
cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving
ML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules
with Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel
encrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore,
optimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus
adjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource
consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference
acceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional
HE pipelines. These findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying
secure ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems that guarantee data confidentiality
under zero-trust cloud conditions.

*Yuansheng Ni,Songcheng Cai,Xiangchao Chen,Jiarong Liang,Zhiheng Lyu,Jiaqi Deng,Kai Zou,Ping Nie,Fei Yuan,Xiang Yue,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents three resources—VisCode-Multi-679K, VisPlotBench, and VisCoder2—to improve visualization coding agents with multi-language support and iterative correction, outperforming open-source models and approaching GPT-4


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visualization coding agents have limitations due to narrow datasets and benchmarks, leading to issues like limited language coverage, unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms.

Method: The authors introduce three resources: (1) VisCode-Multi-679K, a large-scale multi-language dataset with validated code samples and correction dialogues, (2) VisPlotBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating execution and correction, and (3) VisCoder2, a series of multi-language LLMs trained on the dataset.

Result: VisCoder2 outperforms open-source models and approaches the performance of GPT-4, achieving up to 82.4% execution pass rate in large models (32B scale), especially in symbolic/compiler-dependent languages.

Conclusion: The proposed resources support multi-language and iterative correction, showing VisCoder2 significantly improves visualization coding agents’ reliability and capability relative to prior methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled coding agents capable of
generating, executing, and revising visualization code. However, existing
models often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage,
unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has
been constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round
generation and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents.
VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K
validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction
dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for
systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and
protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we
present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on
VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms
strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary
models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching
82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or
compiler-dependent languages.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Agentsway', a novel software development framework tailored for AI agent-based teams, addressing the inadequacy of traditional methods in such environments. It emphasizes human orchestration, privacy-preserving collaboration, and integrates fine-tuned LLMs for adaptive learning and explainable decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional software development methodologies are ill-suited for environments where AI agents autonomously contribute to software development tasks. This creates a critical need for methodologies tailored to AI agent-based development workflows, which is currently lacking.

Method: The paper proposes 'Agentsway', a structured lifecycle framework for AI agent-based software development. Key features include: 1) Specialized agent roles (planning, prompting, coding, testing, fine-tuning) 2) Human orchestration of AI agents 3) Privacy-preserving inter-agent collaboration 4) Integration of fine-tuned LLMs for retrospective learning 5) Embedding of responsible AI principles through coordinated agent interactions

Result: Agentsway provides a framework that enables AI agent-based software development through structured collaboration, iterative improvement, and adaptive learning. The methodology addresses gaps in traditional approaches by formalizing agent-centric workflows, integrating privacy-by-design, and establishing metrics for productivity and trust in AI-driven development.

Conclusion: Agentsway represents a foundational advancement in AI-native software development methodologies. By formalizing agent-centric collaboration, integrating privacy principles, and enabling adaptive learning, the framework establishes a new paradigm for software engineering. This work fills a critical methodological gap, providing the first dedicated approach for AI agent-based development teams.

Abstract: The emergence of Agentic AI is fundamentally transforming how software is
designed, developed, and maintained. Traditional software development
methodologies such as Agile, Kanban, ShapeUp, etc, were originally designed for
human-centric teams and are increasingly inadequate in environments where
autonomous AI agents contribute to planning, coding, testing, and continuous
learning. To address this methodological gap, we present "Agentsway" a novel
software development framework designed for ecosystems where AI agents operate
as first-class collaborators. Agentsway introduces a structured lifecycle
centered on human orchestration, and privacy-preserving collaboration among
specialized AI agents. The framework defines distinct roles for planning,
prompting, coding, testing, and fine-tuning agents, each contributing to
iterative improvement and adaptive learning throughout the development process.
By integrating fine-tuned LLMs that leverage outputs and feedback from
different agents throughout the development cycle as part of a retrospective
learning process, Agentsway enhances domain-specific reasoning, and explainable
decision-making across the entire software development lifecycle. Responsible
AI principles are further embedded across the agents through the coordinated
use of multiple fine-tuned LLMs and advanced reasoning models, ensuring
balanced, transparent, and accountable decision-making. This work advances
software engineering by formalizing agent-centric collaboration, integrating
privacy-by-design principles, and defining measurable metrics for productivity
and trust. Agentsway represents a foundational step toward the next generation
of AI-native, self-improving software development methodologies. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first research effort to introduce a dedicated
methodology explicitly designed for AI agent-based software engineering teams.

*Bin Wang,Hui Li,AoFan Liu,BoTao Yang,Ao Yang,YiLu Zhong,Weixiang Huang,Yanping Zhang,Runhuai Huang,Weimin Zeng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RefleXGen uses RAG and self-reflection to enhance code security in LLM applications without relying on fine-tuning or specialized datasets. Results show security improvements of 4.5% to 13.6% across several models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security is a critical issue in code generation using large language models (LLMs). Traditional methods depend on costly and resource-heavy processes such as model fine-tuning or training with specialized secure code datasets.

Method: RefleXGen integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with guided self-reflection in LLMs. It iteratively optimizes code generation through self-assessment and reflection, enriching the model's knowledge base over time without requiring extensive resources.

Result: RefleXGen achieved 13.6% improvement with GPT-3.5 Turbo, 6.7% with GPT-4o, 4.5% with CodeQwen, and 5.8% with Gemini, showing consistent security enhancements across multiple models.

Conclusion: RefleXGen provides an effective and practical strategy for improving code security in AI systems by enhancing the self-reflection capabilities of LLMs, avoiding traditional, resource-intensive methods.

Abstract: Security in code generation remains a pivotal challenge when applying large
language models (LLMs). This paper introduces RefleXGen, an innovative method
that significantly enhances code security by integrating Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) techniques with guided self-reflection mechanisms inherent in
LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on fine-tuning LLMs or developing
specialized secure code datasets - processes that can be resource-intensive -
RefleXGen iteratively optimizes the code generation process through
self-assessment and reflection without the need for extensive resources. Within
this framework, the model continuously accumulates and refines its knowledge
base, thereby progressively improving the security of the generated code.
Experimental results demonstrate that RefleXGen substantially enhances code
security across multiple models, achieving a 13.6% improvement with GPT-3.5
Turbo, a 6.7% improvement with GPT-4o, a 4.5% improvement with CodeQwen, and a
5.8% improvement with Gemini. Our findings highlight that improving the quality
of model self-reflection constitutes an effective and practical strategy for
strengthening the security of AI-generated code.

### [21] [TDFlow: Agentic Workflows for Test Driven Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23761)
*Kevin Han,Siddharth Maddikayala,Tim Knappe,Om Patel,Austen Liao,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TDFlow is a test-driven agentic workflow achieving human-level test resolution in repository-scale software engineering with 88.8%-94.3% pass rates, demonstrating LLMs can excel in structured workflows but highlight the challenge of autonomous test generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems struggle with software engineering tasks due to long-context burdens and task-agnostic agent roles. The paper addresses this by decomposing program repair into specialized sub-agents.

Method: TDFlow structures program repair into four components (patch proposing, debugging, revision, test generation), using sub-agents with focused tasks and constrained tools to reduce context demands and improve task-specific performance.

Result: 88.8% pass rate on SWE-Bench Lite (27.8PP↑), 94.3_% on SWE-Bench Verified with only 7/800 test-hacking instances. Identifies reproduction test generation as the primary bottleneck to human-level performance.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs achieve human-level test resolution in structured test-driven workflows, but autonomous test generation remains the final barrier to full repository-scale repair autonomy. Human-LLM collaboration is proposed as a path forward.

Abstract: We introduce TDFlow, a novel test-driven agentic workflow that frames
repository-scale software engineering as a test-resolution task, specifically
designed to solve human-written tests. Given a set of tests, TDFlow repeatedly
proposes, revises, and debugs repository-scale patches using precisely
engineered sub-agents and tightly constrained tools. The workflow decomposes
software engineering program repair into four components governed by respective
sub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch
revision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any
individual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined
sub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific
sub-tasks. When provided human-written tests, TDFlow attains 88.8% pass rate on
SWE-Bench Lite (an absolute improvement of 27.8% over the next best system) and
94.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Manual inspection of the 800 TDFlow runs within
SWE-Bench Lite and Verified uncover only 7 instances of test hacking, which
were subsequently counted as failures. Furthermore, we show that the primary
obstacle to human-level software engineering performance lies within writing
successful reproduction tests. We envision a human-LLM interactive system
powered by TDFlow where human developers write tests solved by LLM systems.
Together, these results indicate that modern LLMs, when embedded in a narrowly
engineered, test-driven workflow, already achieve human-level test resolution
-- with the final frontier for fully autonomous repository repair being the
accurate generation of valid reproduction tests.

*Rodrigo Falcão,Stefan Schweitzer,Julien Siebert,Emily Calvet,Frank Elberzhager*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates open-source large language models (LLMs) for autonomous system interoperability in agriculture, identifying qwen2.5-coder:32b as the most effective model across multiple strategies and dataset versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic, heterogeneous systems require interoperability solutions that minimize economic development costs. LLMs offer potential for automated runtime interoperability without human intervention.

Method: 13 open-source LLMs were tested on four agricultural dataset versions using two strategies (DIRECT and CODEGEN) with three runs each, measuring effectiveness and result consistency.

Result: qwen2.5-coder:32b achieved avg pass@1 ≥0.99 (DIRECT) and ≥0.89 (CODEGEN) across three dataset versions. CODEGEN outperformed DIRECT in unit conversion tasks (avg pass@1=0.75).

Conclusion: LLMs enable autonomous system interoperability, but further domain testing and reliability studies are needed for broader application.

Abstract: Background: Systems of systems are becoming increasingly dynamic and
heterogeneous, and this adds pressure on the long-standing challenge of
interoperability. Besides its technical aspect, interoperability has also an
economic side, as development time efforts are required to build the
interoperability artifacts. Objectives: With the recent advances in the field
of large language models (LLMs), we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of
LLM-based strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously, at runtime,
without human intervention. Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated
four versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case. We
performed three runs of each model with each version of the dataset, using two
different strategies. Then we compared the effectiveness of the models and the
consistency of their results across multiple runs. Results: qwen2.5-coder:32b
was the most effective model using both strategies DIRECT (average pass@1 >=
0.99) and CODEGEN (average pass@1 >= 0.89) in three out of four dataset
versions. In the fourth dataset version, which included an unit conversion, all
models using the strategy DIRECT failed, whereas using CODEGEN
qwen2.5-coder:32b succeeded with an average pass@1 = 0.75. Conclusion: Some
LLMs can make systems interoperate autonomously. Further evaluation in
different domains is recommended, and further research on reliability
strategies should be conducted.

*Maria C. Borges,Julian Legler,Lucca Di Benedetto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new alerting extension for the observability tool OXN, addressing the challenges of designing effective alerts through systematic design and validation during development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective alerts is challenging due to the fine balance between catching issues early and minimizing false alarms, compounded by rare alert code execution and a lack of systematic validation tools.

Method: The authors introduce an extension to OXN, an observability experimentation tool, enabling engineers to experiment with alerts during development and validate their behavior at design time.

Result: The extension allows engineers to tune alert rules during development and systematically validate their behavior, reducing the likelihood of issues at runtime.

Conclusion: By integrating alert validation into the development process via OXN's new extension, the approach enables more reliable and systematic alert design, improving overall system reliability.

Abstract: Observability and alerting form the backbone of modern reliability
engineering. Alerts help teams catch faults early before they turn into
production outages and serve as first clues for troubleshooting. However,
designing effective alerts is challenging. They need to strike a fine balance
between catching issues early and minimizing false alarms. On top of this,
alerts often cover uncommon faults, so the code is rarely executed and
therefore rarely checked. To address these challenges, several industry
practitioners advocate for testing alerting code with the same rigor as
application code. Still, there's a lack of tools that support such systematic
design and validation of alerts.
  This paper introduces a new alerting extension for the observability
experimentation tool OXN. It lets engineers experiment with alerts early during
development. With OXN, engineers can now tune rules at design time and
routinely validate the firing behavior of their alerts, avoiding future
problems at runtime.

*Xing Xing,Wei Wang,Lipeng Ma,Weidong Yang,Junjie Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A lifecycle-aware framework for code generation in large language models, incorporating intermediate artifacts during training and inference, leading to significant improvements in code correctness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for code generation that aligns with structured software engineering practices, rather than relying on a direct translation approach from problem descriptions to code.

Method: The proposed method introduces a framework that incorporates intermediate artifacts such as requirements analysis, state machine modeling, and pseudocode into both the training and inference stages of code generation. This aligns code generation with standard software development phases. Training involves lifecycle-level fine-tuning with these intermediate stages, while inference uses multi-step generation leveraging these artifacts for scaffolding.

Result: Lifecycle-level fine-tuning improved code correctness by up to 75% over the same model before fine-tuning. Multi-step inference outperformed single-step generation. Open-source LLMs, after fine-tuning, matched or slightly outperformed code-pretrained models. The framework achieved CodeBLEU improvements of 34.3%, 20.0%, 11.2%, and 22.3% over ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and LLaMA-8B, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed lifecycle-aware framework for code generation effectively enhances code correctness and performance by integrating intermediate artifacts and aligning with software development lifecycles. The robustness of the pipeline with less training data and the distinct contributions of each intermediate artifact confirm the framework's effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has advanced automatic code
generation, yet most approaches rely on direct, single-step translation from
problem descriptions to code, disregarding structured software engineering
practices. We introduce a lifecycle-aware framework that systematically
incorporates intermediate artifacts such as requirements analysis, state
machine modeling, and pseudocode into both the training and inference stages.
This design aligns code generation with standard software development phases
and enables more structured reasoning. Experiments show that lifecycle-level
fine-tuning improves code correctness by up to 75% over the same model before
fine-tuning, with performance gains compounding across intermediate stages.
Multi-step inference consistently surpasses single-step generation,
demonstrating the effectiveness of intermediate scaffolding. Notably,
open-source LLMs, once fine-tuned under our framework, match or slightly
outperform models pretrained on code. When applied to DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B, our
framework yields relative CodeBLEU improvements of 34.3%, 20.0%, 11.2%, and
22.3% over ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and LLaMA-8B,
respectively. Our pipeline also proves robust with up to 80\% less training
data, confirming its resilience. Ablation studies further reveal that each
intermediate artifact contributes distinctly to final code quality, with state
machine modeling yielding the most substantial impact. Our source code and
detailed experimental data are available at

Abstract: Production machine learning (ML) systems fail silently -- not with crashes,
but through wrong decisions. While observability is recognized as critical for
ML operations, there is a lack empirical evidence of what practitioners
actually capture. This study presents empirical results on ML observability in
practice through seven focus group sessions in several domains. We catalog the
information practitioners systematically capture across ML systems and their

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates software aging in LLM-generated applications by stress-testing four apps for 50 hours, revealing memory leaks, performance instability, and degradation patterns, emphasizing the need for long-term reliability strategies in automatically generated software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated code is expanding in software development, yet its long-term reliability under sustained use remains unexplored, risking unexpected failures in critical systems. This study fills this gap by empirically analyzing software aging in LLM-derived applications.

Method: The authors used the Bolt platform and Baxbench prompts to generate four service-oriented applications, which were subjected to continuous 50-hour load tests. Resource consumption, response time, and throughput were monitored to identify aging patterns, with statistical analysis validating degradation trends.

Result: All tested applications exhibited severe software aging symptoms: progressive memory growth, exponentially increasing response times, and declining throughput. Statistical analysis confirmed these trends and showed variability in aging severity across different application types.

Conclusion: LLM-generated software is vulnerable to aging effects over time, challenging assumptions about its reliability. This work establishes the first empirical evidence of such issues and paves the way for developing mitigation techniques and long-term stability evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Automatically generated software, especially code produced by Large Language
Models (LLMs), is increasingly adopted to accelerate development and reduce
manual effort. However, little is known about the long-term reliability of such
systems under sustained execution. In this paper, we experimentally investigate
the phenomenon of software aging in applications generated by LLM-based tools.
Using the Bolt platform and standardized prompts from Baxbench, we generated
four service-oriented applications and subjected them to 50-hour load tests.
Resource usage, response time, and throughput were continuously monitored to
detect degradation patterns. The results reveal significant evidence of
software aging, including progressive memory growth, increased response time,
and performance instability across all applications. Statistical analyzes
confirm these trends and highlight variability in the severity of aging
according to the type of application. Our findings show the need to consider
aging in automatically generated software and provide a foundation for future
studies on mitigation strategies and long-term reliability evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Code clone detection is a fundamental task in software engineering that
underpins refactoring, debugging, plagiarism detection, and vulnerability
analysis. Existing methods often rely on singular representations such as
abstract syntax trees (ASTs), control flow graphs (CFGs), and data flow graphs
(DFGs), which capture only partial aspects of code semantics. Hybrid approaches
have emerged, but their fusion strategies are typically handcrafted and
ineffective. In this study, we propose MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional
framework that jointly leverages AST, CFG, and DFG representations to capture
syntactic and semantic features of source code. MAGNET integrates residual
graph neural networks with node-level self-attention to learn both local and
long-range dependencies, introduces a gated cross-attention mechanism for
fine-grained inter-graph interactions, and employs Set2Set pooling to fuse
multi-graph embeddings into unified program-level representations. Extensive
experiments on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam demonstrate that MAGNET
achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1 score of 96.5\% and
99.2\% on the two datasets, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical
contributions of multi-graph fusion and each attentional component. Our code is

TL;DR: The study finds that while Generative AI tools are being adopted in software development to boost productivity, the actual improvements in various dimensions of developer productivity are limited, suggesting a productivity paradox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand the real impact of Generative AI (GenAI) tools on software developer productivity, as current evidence is unclear regarding the specific contexts and aspects where these tools provide enhancement.

Method: The paper involved surveying 415 software practitioners about their perceptions of GenAI's impact using the SPACE framework dimensions: Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication, and Efficiency.

Result: Results show limited overall changes in productivity dimensions, indicating a productivity paradox where developers become faster but do not necessarily improve software quality or fulfillment.

Conclusion: Adoption of GenAI tools in software development does not consistently lead to better productivity outcomes as intended, with only minor beneficial impacts observed across the measured productivity factors.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are increasingly being adopted in software
development as productivity aids. However, evidence regarding where and when
these tools actually enhance productivity is unclear. In this paper, we
investigate how GenAI adoption affects different dimensions of developer
productivity. We surveyed 415 software practitioners to capture their
perceptions of productivity changes associated with AI-assisted development
using the SPACE framework - Satisfaction and well-being, Performance, Activity,
Communication and collaboration, and Efficiency and flow. Our results,
disaggregated by frequency of AI usage, reveal limited overall productivity
change, highlighting the productivity paradox in which developers become faster
but do not necessarily create better software or feel more fulfilled.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for code agents have high annotation costs, expertise requirements, and rigid unit-test-based evaluation metrics, limiting effective project-level assessment.

Method: Proposes an agent-driven pipeline with human supervision to generate diverse project-level tasks, creates PRDBench with 50 Python projects across 20 domains including PRD requirements and reference implementations, and employs an Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm for flexible metric evaluation.

Conclusion: PRDBench addresses current benchmark limitations by offering rich data sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics, enabling robust evaluation of code agents and evaluation agents in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in code agents have enabled automated software development at
the project level, supported by large language models (LLMs) and widely adopted
tools. However, existing benchmarks for code agent evaluation face two major
limitations: high annotation cost and expertise requirements, and rigid
evaluation metrics that rely primarily on unit tests. To address these
challenges, we propose an agent-driven benchmark construction pipeline that
leverages human supervision to efficiently generate diverse and challenging
project-level tasks. Based on this approach, we introduce PRDBench, a novel
benchmark comprising 50 real-world Python projects across 20 domains, each with
structured Product Requirement Document (PRD) requirements, comprehensive
evaluation criteria, and reference implementations. PRDBench features rich data
sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an
Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of
various test types beyond unit tests. Extensive experiments on PRDBench
demonstrate its effectiveness in assessing the capabilities of both code agents
and evaluation agents, providing a scalable and robust framework for annotation
and evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the scalability challenge in evaluating LLM-generated software artifacts, proposes LLM-as-a-Judge as a solution, and outlines a 2030 roadmap for developing reliable automated evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge in LLM-generated software artifacts requires scalable evaluation methods; human evaluation is impractical, and traditional metrics like BLEU lack nuance. LLM-as-a-Judge could bridge this gap but lacks systematic research in SE contexts.

Method: Literature review of existing SE studies on LLM-as-a-Judge, analysis of limitations, and identification of research gaps to build a structured advancement roadmap.

Result: Highlights key gaps (e.g., robustness, scalability, multi-dimensional evaluation criteria), validates LLM-as-a-Judge's potential, and proposes a vision for 2030 frameworks meeting human-like standards.

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks could revolutionize software artifact evaluation by 2030 through community-driven research focused on reliability, robustness, and multi-faceted automation.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software
engineering (SE) has revolutionized tasks like code generation, producing a
massive volume of software artifacts. This surge has exposed a critical
bottleneck: the lack of scalable, reliable methods to evaluate these outputs.
Human evaluation is costly and time-consuming, while traditional automated
metrics like BLEU fail to capture nuanced quality aspects. In response, the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm - using LLMs for automated evaluation - has emerged.
This approach leverages the advanced reasoning of LLMs, offering a path toward
human-like nuance at automated scale. However, LLM-as-a-Judge research in SE is
still in its early stages. This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the
community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLM-generated software
artifacts. We provide a literature review of existing SE studies, analyze their
limitations, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap. We
envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates
capable of consistent, multi-faceted artifact evaluation by 2030. Our work aims
to foster research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, ultimately
improving the scalability of software artifact evaluation.

### [31] [CodeWiki: Automated Repository-Level Documentation at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24428)
*Nguyen Hoang Anh,Minh Le-Anh,Bach Le,Nghi D. Q. Bui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeWiki is an open-source framework addressing repository-level documentation via three innovations, achieving high quality scores with proprietary and open-source LLMs while introducing a benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers spend 58% of time understanding codebases; existing LLM tools fail at capturing repository-level architectural context and cross-module interactions due to complexity and manual effort.

Method: CodeWiki employs (i) hierarchical decomposition for architectural context, (ii) recursive agentic processing with delegation, and (iii) synthesis of textual/visual artifacts. CodeWikiBench includes multi-level rubrics and agentic assessment.

Result: Achieved 68.79% quality score with proprietary models and 64.80% with open-source models, outperforming closed-source systems across 7 languages and real-world repositories.

Conclusion: CodeWiki is the first open-source framework to enable scalable, accurate repository-level documentation, demonstrating effectiveness through architectural analysis and benchmarking.

Abstract: Developers spend nearly 58% of their time understanding codebases, yet
maintaining comprehensive documentation remains challenging due to complexity
and manual effort. While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
function-level documentation, they fail at the repository level, where
capturing architectural patterns and cross-module interactions is essential. We
introduce CodeWiki, the first open-source framework for holistic
repository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki
employs three innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves
architectural context, (ii) recursive agentic processing with dynamic
delegation, and (iii) synthesis of textual and visual artifacts including
architecture diagrams and data flows. We also present CodeWikiBench, the first
repository-level documentation benchmark with multi-level rubrics and agentic
assessment. CodeWiki achieves 68.79% quality score with proprietary models and
64.80% with open-source alternatives, outperforming existing closed-source
systems and demonstrating scalable, accurate documentation for real-world
repositories.

### [32] [The Divine Software Engineering Comedy -- Inferno: The Okinawa Files](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24483)
*Michele Lanza*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper is a reflective essay by an author who co-organized the FUSE symposium in June 2024. The author presents a critical and satirical perspective on the future of software engineering (SE), identifying three main challenges or 'nightmares' for the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The essay is motivated by the author's personal experience and observations during the FUSE symposium, where industry and academic experts engaged in discussions about the trajectory of software engineering. The author's critical viewpoint likely stems from a desire to highlight real concerns and issues within the field.

Method: The author's method involves interpreting the content and opinions expressed at the symposium, combined with their own insight and critical thinking. The style is subjective and ironic, distilling complex ideas into an accessible narrative.

Result: The main result is a critical analysis that identifies three primary issues facing the future of software engineering: 1) inexperienced software developers managing complex tasks. 2) A rapidly evolving field that forgets its lessons. 3) An uncontrolled proliferation of technologies.

Conclusion: The author posits a bleak outlook for software engineering's future, emphasizing these critical challenges and the lack of a clear vision or solution for their resolution. The use of humor and cynicism underscores these serious points.

Abstract: In June 2024 I co-organized the FUture of Software Engineering symposium in
Okinawa, Japan. Me, Andrian Marcus, Takashi Kobayashi and Shinpei Hayashi were
general chairs, Nicole Novielli, Kevin Moran, Yutaro Kashiwa and Masanari Kondo
were program chairs, some members of my group, Carmen Armenti, Stefano
Campanella, Roberto Minelli, were the tables, can't have a room with only
chairs, after all. We invited a crowd of people to discuss what future software
engineering has. FUSE became a 3-day marathon on whether there is actually a
future at all for SE. This essay is a slightly dark take about what I saw at
that event, very loosely based on the discussions that took place, adding some
healthy sarcasm and cynicism, the intellectual salt and pepper I never seem to
run out of. I listened to the brilliant people who gathered to talk about where
we're headed, and distilled three nightmares headed in our direction: software
makers who don't know what they're doing, but get the job done anyway, a field
moving so fast it can't remember its own lessons, and technologies multiplying
like rabbits in Spring. So, let's start. The future, eh? The future of software
engineering looks like a car crash in slow motion: you can see it coming but
you can't look away. The thing is...
