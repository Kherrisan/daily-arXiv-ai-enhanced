Our\nbenchmark contains 12,504 formal specifications, with 3,029 in Dafny, 2,334 in\nVerus/Rust and 7,141 in Lean. Of these, 6,174 are new unseen problems. We find\nvericoding success rates of 27% in Lean, 44% in Verus/Rust and 82% in Dafny\nusing off-the-shelf LLMs. Adding natural-language descriptions does not\nsignificantly improve performance. We also find that LLM progress has improved\nprogress on pure Dafny verification from 68% to 96% over the past year.

Adding natural-language descriptions doesn't notably enhance performance. Dafny verification improved from 68% to 96% over a year.", "conclusion": "A large and diverse vericoding benchmark was created and tested; LLMs show best performance on Dafny. There is room for improvement as lower rates persist in other languages."}}
