Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate\ntheir objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions\nacross multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,\nextant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which\nintroduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability.

Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly\nassume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing\nspecific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers\ncan manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the\ntraining dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the\nVLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes\npredefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.\nSpecifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO\nthat incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.\nIn addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim\nVLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and\nsuccess to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to\nsuccessfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the\nphysical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on\nclean inputs.

In 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nstandardized several PQC algorithms, marking an important milestone in the\ntransition toward quantum-resistant security.

This has security implications, as a kernel compromise has immediate\nand significant effects on the entire system. Over the past few years, Apple\nhas taken steps towards a more compartmentalized kernel architecture and a more\nmicrokernel-like design.

In this paper, we\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of new security mechanisms and their\ninterplay, and create the first conclusive writeup considering all current\nmitigations. SPTM acts as the sole authority regarding memory retyping. Our\nanalysis reveals that, through SPTM domains based on frame retyping and memory\nmapping rule sets, SPTM introduces domains of trust into the system,\neffectively gapping different functionalities from one another.

Ensuring the correctness of ML\nlibraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict\ninput constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated\ntest generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and\noften create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and\nlimited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from\nofficial API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach\nthat improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to\ngenerate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and\nhigher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and\nTensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin. The results show that\nPynguinML significantly improves test effectiveness, achieving up to 63.9 %\nhigher code coverage."}

Yet most current\ndigital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data\ntypes, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper\nintroduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in\nsilico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial,\nbehavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model.\nImplemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports\nautomated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its\nontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and\ndiagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse\nevents), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively\nrefined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot\nstudy in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients.\nEvaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and\nGDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous\ndata, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive,\nand prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By\nbridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT\nprovides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems,\ntransforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and\nequitable management."}

However, its\nadoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict\nprivacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical\nsystems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering\n(MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies\non formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated\ntransformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At\nits core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that\nenables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning\npipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning\narchitecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw\npatient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving\nprivacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy\nstudy. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with\nsupport vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy\nin key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings\nsuggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated\ncode generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable,\nreproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms."}

However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two\ncritical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific\nfeatures, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the\noutput, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic\nalignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,\nresulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original\nsource. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured\nInstruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT\nconsists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the\nsyntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic\nsyntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality\nfine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation\nmodule aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and\ncontrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction\ntuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused\nby the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs\nsyntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend\nstructured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code\ngeneration fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code\nbased on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing\napproaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in\ncode translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion."}

Based on the Cloud Security\nAlliance (CSA) Top Threats to Cloud Computing Deep Dive 2025 Report, our\nanalysis details how standing permissions cause catastrophic cloud breaches.\nWhile current security tools are addressing network and API security, the\nchallenge of securing granular data access remains. Removing standing\npermissions at the data level is as critical as it is at the network level,\nespecially for companies handling valuable data at scale.\n  In this white paper, we introduce an innovative architecture based on\non-demand data enclaves to address this gap directly. Our approach enables Zero\nStanding Privilege (ZSP) and Just-in-Time (JIT) principles at the data level.\nWe replace static permissions with temporary data contracts that enforce\nproactive protection. This means separation is built around the data requested\non-demand, providing precise access and real time monitoring for individual\nrecords instead of datasets. This solution drastically reduces the attack\nsurface, prevents privilege creep, and simplifies auditing, offering a vital\npath for enterprises to transition to a more secure and resilient data\nenvironment."}
