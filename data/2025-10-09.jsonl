In many\nsoftware teams, cybersecurity experts are either entirely absent or represented\nby only a small number of specialists. As a result, the workload for these\nexperts becomes high, and software engineers would need to conduct\ncybersecurity activities themselves. This creates a need for a tool to support\ncybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats\nduring the risk assessment process. This paper explores the potential of\nleveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented\ngeneration to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain\nwhile complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit\nexternal data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts\nin interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project.\nThe results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by\ngenerating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing\nredundancy checks. The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight\nto ensure accuracy and compliance. Despite trust concerns, experts were willing\nto utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely\nrelying on their generative capabilities. This study provides insights that\nencourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of\ncyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains."}

Conducting systematic reviews is laborious,\nespecially during the screening or study selection phase, where the number of\npapers can be overwhelming.

Recent\nresearch has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can perform\ntitle-abstract screening at a level comparable to that of a master's student.\nWhile LLMs cannot be fully trusted, they can help, for example, in Rapid\nReviews, which try to expedite the review process. Building on recent research,\nwe developed AiSysRev, an LLM-based screening tool implemented as a web\napplication running in a Docker container. The tool accepts a CSV file\ncontaining paper titles and abstracts. Users specify inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria. One can use multiple LLMs for screening via OpenRouter. AiSysRev\nsupports both zero-shot and few-shot screening, and also allows for manual\nscreening through interfaces that display LLM results as guidance for human\nreviewers.We conducted a trial study with 137 papers using the tool. Our\nfindings indicate that papers can be classified into four categories: Easy\nIncludes, Easy Excludes, Boundary Includes, and Boundary Excludes. The Boundary\ncases, where LLMs are prone to errors, highlight the need for human\nintervention.

LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a key technique to\naddress this, which aims to verify a model's origin by extracting an intrinsic,\nunique signature (a \"fingerprint\") and comparing it to that of a source model\nto identify illicit copies. However, existing black-box fingerprinting methods\noften fail to generate distinctive LLM fingerprints. This ineffectiveness\narises because black-box methods typically rely on model outputs, which lose\ncritical information about the model's unique parameters due to the usage of\nnon-linear functions. To address this, we first leverage Fisher Information\nTheory to formally demonstrate that the gradient of the model's input is a more\ninformative feature for fingerprinting than the output.

As CUAs in\nthe OS domain become increasingly embedded in daily operations, it is\nimperative to examine their real-world security implications, specifically\nwhether CUAs can be misused to perform realistic, security-relevant attacks.\nExisting works exhibit four major limitations: Missing attacker-knowledge model\non tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), Incomplete coverage for\nend-to-end kill chains, unrealistic environment without multi-host and\nencrypted user credentials, and unreliable judgment dependent on\nLLM-as-a-Judge. To address these gaps, we propose AdvCUA, the first benchmark\naligned with real-world TTPs in MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix, which comprises\n140 tasks, including 40 direct malicious tasks, 74 TTP-based malicious tasks,\nand 26 end-to-end kill chains, systematically evaluates CUAs under a realistic\nenterprise OS security threat in a multi-host environment sandbox by hard-coded\nevaluation.

These systems - but also the deception technologies not based on LLMs -\nlack an extensive evaluation that includes human attackers. Generative AI has\nrecently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and\npractitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers\nhave demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking\nhoneytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as\nhoneypots. This paper presents an AI-based deception framework called VelLMes,\nwhich can simulate multiple protocols and services such as SSH Linux shell,\nMySQL, POP3, and HTTP. All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus\nVelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users'\nneeds. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and\nrealism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities\nand the deception capabilities. Generative capabilities were evaluated using\nunit tests for LLMs. The results of the unit tests show that, with careful\nprompting, LLMs can produce realistic-looking responses, with some LLMs having\na 100% passing rate. In the case of the SSH Linux shell, we evaluated deception\ncapabilities with 89 human attackers. The results showed that about 30% of the\nattackers thought that they were interacting with a real system when they were\nassigned an LLM-based honeypot. Lastly, we deployed 10 instances of the SSH\nLinux shell honeypot on the Internet to capture real-life attacks.

One problem reduction\nprovides a novel, counter-intuitive perspective, and combining the two problem\nreductions enables significant improvements in dynamic programming algorithms\nsuch as value iteration.
