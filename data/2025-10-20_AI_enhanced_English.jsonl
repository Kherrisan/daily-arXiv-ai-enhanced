Even though traditional\nmachine learning models have shown to be effective in fraud detections, they\noften compromise user data by requiring centralized access to sensitive\ninformation. In IoT-enabled financial endpoints such as ATMs and POS Systems\nthat regularly produce sensitive data that is sent over the network. Federated\nLearning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving, decentralized model training across\ninstitutions without sharing raw data. FL enables cross-silo collaboration\namong banks while also using cross-device learning on IoT endpoints. This\nsurvey explores the role of FL in enhancing financial security and introduces a\nnovel classification of its applications based on regulatory and compliance\nexposure levels ranging from low-exposure tasks such as collaborative portfolio\noptimization to high-exposure tasks like real-time fraud detection. Unlike\nprior surveys, this work reviews FL's practical use within financial systems,\ndiscussing its regulatory compliance and recent successes in fraud prevention\nand blockchain-integrated frameworks. However, FL deployment in finance is not\nwithout challenges. Data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks, and regulatory\ncompliance make implementation far from easy. This survey reviews current\ndefense mechanisms and discusses future directions, including blockchain\nintegration, differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, and\nquantum-secure frameworks. Ultimately, this work aims to be a resource for\nresearchers exploring FL's potential to advance secure, privacy-compliant\nfinancial systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Survey shows FL enhances financial security with decentralized, privacy-preserving machine learning, classifying applications by risk level and mapping practical challenges like data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks, and regulatory compliance to guide future research on blockchain integration and quantum-safe solutions.", "motivation": "Digital financial systems face security/privacy risks from centralized traditional ML methods in IoT-enabled environments (ATMs/POS).
