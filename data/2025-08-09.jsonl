In this study, we evaluate\nthe capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML\nprojects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing\n4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed\nthe original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them,\nand evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text\nquality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we\nmanually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common\npatterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place\nas humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of\n82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level\nlogging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function,\ndifficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with\nproject-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for\ngenerating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed\nfor practical implementation."}

However,\nrecent results have shown that SDLP in finite groups admits efficient quantum\nalgorithms, undermining its quantum resistance. This raises a fundamental\nquestion: does the SDLP offer any computational advantages over the standard\ndiscrete logarithm problem (DLP) against classical adversaries? In this work,\nwe investigate the classical hardness of SDLP across different finite group\nplatforms. We establish that the group-case SDLP can be reformulated as a\ngeneralized discrete logarithm problem, enabling adaptation of classical\nalgorithms to study its complexity. We present a concrete adaptation of the\nBaby-Step Giant-Step algorithm for SDLP, achieving time and space complexity\n$O(\\sqrt{r})$ where $r$ is the period of the underlying cycle structure.\nThrough theoretical analysis and experimental validation in SageMath, we\ndemonstrate that the classical hardness of SDLP is highly platform-dependent\nand does not uniformly exceed that of standard DLP. In finite fields\n$\\mathbb{F}_p^*$, both problems exhibit comparable complexity. Surprisingly, in\nelliptic curves $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, the SDLP becomes trivial due to the bounded\nautomorphism group, while in elementary abelian groups $\\mathbb{F}_p^n$, the\nSDLP can be harder than DLP, with complexity varying based on the eigenvalue\nstructure of the automorphism.

In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple\ncomponents across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.\nThey serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing\nconfigurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like\ndocumentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary\nstudy on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system.

Second, to accurately score\nreasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method\nfor reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs\nby systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along\ncurated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical\nrigor, and coherence.

While earlier\napproaches have relied on rule-based systems and domain-specific Named Entity\nRecognition (NER) models, these methods fail to generalize across formats and\ncontexts. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising\nalternative, yet the effect of architectural and training choices on redaction\nperformance remains underexplored. LLMs have demonstrated strong performance in\ntasks that require contextual language understanding, including the redaction\nof PII in free-form text. Prior work suggests that with appropriate adaptation,\nLLMs can become effective contextual privacy learners. However, the\nconsequences of architectural and training choices for PII Redaction remain\nunderexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of LLMs as\nprivacy-preserving PII Redaction systems. We evaluate a range of LLM\narchitectures and training strategies for their effectiveness in PII Redaction.\nOur analysis measures redaction performance, semantic preservation, and PII\nleakage, and compares these outcomes against latency and computational cost.\nThe results provide practical guidance for configuring LLM-based redactors that\nare accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware. To support reproducibility and\nreal-world deployment, we release PRvL, an open-source suite of fine-tuned\nmodels, and evaluation tools for general-purpose PII Redaction. PRvL is built\nentirely on open-source LLMs and supports multiple inference settings for\nflexibility and compliance. It is designed to be easily customized for\ndifferent domains and fully operable within secure, self-managed environments.\nThis enables data owners to perform redactions without relying on third-party\nservices or exposing sensitive content beyond their own infrastructure."}

Although already studied in Business Process Management (BPM),\nsustainability research has primarily focused on environmental concerns.\nHowever, achieving a holistic and lasting impact requires a systematic approach\nto address sustainability beyond the environmental dimension. This work\nproposes a conceptual model and a structured methodology with the goal of\nanalyzing the potential of IoT to measure and improve the sustainability of\nBPs. The conceptual model formally represents key sustainability concepts,\nlinking BPM and IoT by highlighting how IoT devices support and contribute to\nsustainability. The methodology guides the systematic analysis of existing BPs,\nidentifies opportunities, and implements sustainability-aware, IoT-enhanced\nBPs. The approach is illustrated through a running example from the tourism\ndomain and a case study in healthcare."}
