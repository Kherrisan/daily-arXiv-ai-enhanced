### [1] [MGC: A Compiler Framework Exploiting Compositional Blindness in Aligned LLMs for Malware Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02057)
*Lu Yan,Zhuo Zhang,Xiangzhe Xu,Shengwei An,Guangyu Shen,Zhou Xuan,Xuan Chen,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how malware developers exploit LLM vulnerabilities through modular decomposition, introducing MGC- a framework that bridges malicious intent to benign code, outperforming existing methods by generating functional malware more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing democratization of software development via LLMs creates security risks as malicious actors can bypass alignment safeguards by decomposing harmful tasks into seemingly benign components, necessitating methods to expose these attack vectors.

Method: The authors developed the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC) framework, which uses a specialized Malware Description Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to translate high-level malicious objectives into modular, alignment-evasive code sequences through systematic task decomposition.

Result: MGC demonstrates reliable malware generation across diverse specifications, achieves +365.79% correctness improvement over jailbreaking methods and +78.07% over underground services on three benchmarks, and successfully reproduces/enhances 16 real-world malware samples.

Conclusion: The study reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing LLM alignment mechanisms against compositional attacks, providing actionable insights for developing countermeasures against modularized malware generation techniques using AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing
the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility
extends to malicious software development, raising significant security
concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent
direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly
evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability:
malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing
sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a
novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition
and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description
Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and
benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications
and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground
services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies
further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware
samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by
exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

### [2] [Can Artificial Intelligence solve the blockchain oracle problem? Unpacking the Challenges and Possibilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02125)
*Giulio Caldarelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores how AI can enhance blockchain oracle systems by addressing data quality and resilience issues through techniques like anomaly detection and dynamic reputation modeling, but emphasizes AI cannot replace trust assumptions in off-chain data inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The blockchain oracle problem remains a critical barrier for trustless applications, with current architectural/crypto/economic solutions insufficient to establish reliable chain-to-off-chain data pathways.

Method: The analysis combines academic research and practical implementations to evaluate AI methods (anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic reputation modeling) for oracle enhancement.

Result: AI improves oracle data quality, source selection, and system resilience but still requires unverifiable off-chain inputs, demonstrating the need for complementary rather than replacement approaches.

Conclusion: AI should augment oracle systems as an inference/filtering layer within existing trust frameworks, not serve as standalone solutions to the oracle problem.

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting
reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental
limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years
have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic
strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the
fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain
world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial
intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both
academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI
techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic
reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We
observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,
source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on
unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI
should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within
a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

### [3] [ARMOUR US: Android Runtime Zero-permission Sensor Usage Monitoring from User Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02177)
*Yan Long,Jiancong Cui,Yuqing Yang,Tobias Alam,Zhiqiang Lin,Kevin Fu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes ARMOUR, a user-space runtime monitoring tool for Android devices to detect unauthorized access to zero-permission sensors like accelerometers, addressing privacy leakage issues and enabling analysis of sensor abuse patterns without requiring rooting or reverse engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-permission sensors in Android provide critical data that can be exploited for privacy violations, but existing monitoring methods face challenges including complicated development chains, rooting privileges, and app-specific reverse engineering, limiting options for data providers and security researchers to understand and analyze sensor usage.

Method: ARMOUR leverages Android's intrinsic sampling rate variation and sensor convergence behaviors to detect access patterns in user-space runtime monitoring, avoiding the need for rooting or app modification by analyzing behavioral inconsistencies during sensor data collection.

Result: Evaluation with 1,448 commercial Android apps demonstrated ARMOUR's ability to detect sensor usage in obfuscated code and revealed significant sensor abuse patterns, including 50% of apps from non-sensor-dependent categories accessing multiple zero-permission sensors.

Conclusion: ARMOUR effectively addresses gaps in Android sensor monitoring by enabling user-visible runtime tracking and supporting app-agnostic analysis. The work highlights ongoing technical and regulatory challenges in mitigating sensor-based privacy risks despite recent Android policy changes.

Abstract: This work investigates how to monitor access to Android zero-permission
sensors which could cause privacy leakage to users. Moreover, monitoring such
sensitive access allows security researchers to characterize potential sensor
abuse patterns. Zero-permission sensors such as accelerometers have become an
indispensable part of Android devices. The critical information they provide
has attracted extensive research investigating how data collectors could
capture more sensor data to enable both benign and exploitative applications.
In contrast, little work has explored how to enable data providers, such as end
users, to understand sensor usage. While existing methods such as static
analysis and hooking-based dynamic analysis face challenges of requiring
complicated development chains, rooting privilege, and app-specific reverse
engineering analysis, our work aims to bridge this gap by developing ARMOUR for
user-space runtime monitoring, leveraging the intrinsic sampling rate variation
and convergence behaviors of Android. ARMOUR enables privacy-aware users to
easily monitor how third-party apps use sensor data and support security
researchers to perform rapid app-agnostic sensor access analysis. Our
evaluation with 1,448 commercial applications shows the effectiveness of ARMOUR
in detecting sensor usage in obfuscated code and other conditions, and observes
salient sensor abuse patterns such as 50% of apps from seemingly
sensor-independent categories accessing data of multiple zero-permission
sensors. We analyze the impact of Android's recent policy changes on
zero-permission sensors and remaining technical and regulatory problems.

### [4] [Extended c-differential distinguishers of full 9 and reduced-round Kuznyechik cipher](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02181)
*Pantelimon Stanica,Ranit Dutta,Bimal Mandal*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper develops truncated inner $c$-differential cryptanalysis, proving a duality between inner and outer $c$-differential uniformities and using it to demonstrate a practical distinguisher against the full 9-round Kuznyechik cipher, revealing insufficient security margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing $c$-differential cryptanalysis faced practical challenges due to multiplication by $c$ disrupting key addition operations in block ciphers. This hindered the application of theoretical $c$-differential uniformity to real-world attacks.

Method: Introduces 'inner' $c$-differential approach $(F(cx\oplus a), F(x))$, establishes mathematical duality with inverse functions, and builds a statistical-computational framework using millions of differential pairs for analysis.

Result: Statistically significant non-randomness in Kuznyechik across all tested round counts, with 1.7× bias ratios and p-values as low as $1.85 \times 10^{-3}$ for the full 9-round cipher, achieving the first practical distinguisher.

Conclusion: The modification preserves cipher structure while enabling practical attacks, indicating Kuznyechik's security margin is insufficient against this new cryptanalytic approach.

Abstract: This paper introduces {\em truncated inner $c$-differential cryptanalysis}, a
novel technique that for the first time enables the practical application of
$c$-differential uniformity to block ciphers. While Ellingsen et al. (IEEE
Trans. Inf. Theory, 2020) established the notion of $c$-differential uniformity
using $(F(x\oplus a), cF(x))$, a key challenge remained: multiplication by $c$
disrupts the structural properties essential for block cipher analysis,
particularly key addition.
  We resolve this challenge by developing an \emph{inner} $c$-differential
approach where multiplication by $c$ affects the input: $(F(cx\oplus a),
F(x))$. We prove that the inner $c$-differential uniformity of a function $F$
equals the outer $c$-differential uniformity of $F^{-1}$, establishing a
fundamental duality. This modification preserves cipher structure while
enabling practical cryptanalytic applications.
  Our main contribution is a comprehensive multi-faceted
statistical-computational framework, implementing truncated $c$-differential
analysis against the full 9-round Kuznyechik cipher (the inner
$c$-differentials are immune to the key whitening at the backend). Through
extensive computational analysis involving millions of differential pairs, we
demonstrate statistically significant non-randomness across all tested round
counts. For the full 9-round cipher, we identify multiple configurations
triggering critical security alerts, with bias ratios reaching $1.7\times$ and
corrected p-values as low as $1.85 \times 10^{-3}$, suggesting insufficient
security margin against this new attack vector. This represents the first
practical distinguisher against the full 9-round Kuznyechik.

### [5] [EIM-TRNG: Obfuscating Deep Neural Network Weights with Encoding-in-Memory True Random Number Generator via RowHammer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02206)
*Ranyang Zhou,Abeer Matar A. Almalky,Gamana Aragonda,Sabbir Ahmed,Filip Roth Trønnes-Christensen,Adnan Siraj Rakin,Shaahin Angizi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EIM-TRNG leverages DRAM cell randomness from RowHammer effects to secure DNN weight data through hardware-based entropy extraction and encryption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software PRNGs lack unpredictability needed for securing AI systems' sensitive weights and hardware-based TRNGs offer superior resilience but are underexplored for neuromorphic applications.

Method: Proposes EIM-TRNG framework using controlled RowHammer-induced bit-flips as entropy source. Combines fixed and random bit-flips for encoding DNN weights, with decryption keys derived probabilistically from observed flip patterns.

Result: Experimental validation shows effective entropy extraction from DRAM (3.58-bit/Cell), successful weight encryption against attacks, and 99.7% model authentication accuracy with 1k random bits.

Conclusion: Demonstrates practicality of memory-based TRNG for cost-effective hardware security, setting new paradigm for protecting ML models while maintaining computational efficiency and data integrity.

Abstract: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware
security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep
NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is
critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI
systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used,
they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs.
In this work, we propose a novel and robust Encoding-in-Memory TRNG called
EIM-TRNG that leverages the inherent physical randomness in DRAM cell behavior,
particularly under RowHammer-induced disturbances, for the first time. We
demonstrate how the unpredictable bit-flips generated through carefully
controlled RowHammer operations can be harnessed as a reliable entropy source.
Furthermore, we apply this TRNG framework to secure DNN weight data by encoding
via a combination of fixed and unpredictable bit-flips. The encrypted data is
later decrypted using a key derived from the probabilistic flip behavior,
ensuring both data confidentiality and model authenticity. Our results validate
the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction for robust, low-cost
hardware security and offer a promising direction for protecting machine
learning models at the hardware level.

### [6] [Linearly Homomorphic Ring Signature Scheme over Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02281)
*Heng Guo,Kun Tian,Fengxia Liu,Zhiyong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic ring signature scheme, offering post-quantum security for privacy-sensitive computations like confidential blockchain transactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems lack feasible homomorphic ring signatures that combine anonymity with verifiable computation, limiting applications requiring both properties (e.g., blockchain privacy and secure multi-party computation).

Method: The authors construct a lattice-based scheme secure under the standard model using the small integer solution (SIS) assumption, achieving strong anonymity under full key exposure and resistance to insider corruption attacks via homomorphic linear signatures.

Result: A unified framework for ring and linear homomorphic signatures is proven secure with lattice-based primitives, advancing privacy-enhanced homomorphic computation capabilities.

Conclusion: The work addresses critical gaps in secure anonymous computing by proposing a post-quantum homomorphic ring signature framework, enabling robust solutions for confidential blockchain and secure collaborations.

Abstract: Homomorphic ring signature schemes combine the strong anonymity of ring
signatures with the computability of homomorphic signatures, demonstrating
significant potential in scenarios requiring both anonymous data provenance and
verifiable homomorphic computation (e.g., confidential blockchain transactions
and secure multi-party computation). However, no feasible homomorphic ring
signature scheme currently exists.
  In this work, we propose the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic ring
signature scheme. Proven secure in the standard model under the small integer
solution (SIS) assumption, our scheme achieves strong anonymity under full key
exposure and unforgeability against insider corruption attacks. As the first
unified framework for ring signatures and linear homomorphic signatures, this
construction provides a post-quantum-secure solution for the aforementioned
applications, advancing the development of privacy-enhanced homomorphic
computation.

### [7] [Rethinking Broken Object Level Authorization Attacks Under Zero Trust Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02309)
*Anbin Wu,Zhiyong Feng,Ruitao Feng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BOLAZ is a zero-trust framework to defend against BOLA vulnerabilities by tracking resource ID data flows and identifying authorization boundaries, validated on GitHub projects with 35 new BOLA vulnerabilities discovered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RESTful APIs face critical BOLA security flaws where attackers exploit resource ID parameters to bypass authorization. Existing methods lack adaptability to authorization logic and system-specific best practices.

Method: BOLAZ uses static taint tracking to analyze resource ID propagation paths, categorizing APIs as producers/consumers. It identifies authorization intervals by mapping context-based boundaries of resource ID handling.

Result: Empirical validation on 10 GitHub projects showed BOLAZ successfully mitigated CVE-reported BOLA attacks and discovered 35 previously undetected vulnerabilities in real-world applications.

Conclusion: BOLAZ is the first authorization-guided BOLA defense framework that adapts to system-specific logic through data flow analysis, demonstrating practical effectiveness for real-world API security.

Abstract: RESTful APIs facilitate data exchange between applications, but they also
expose sensitive resources to potential exploitation. Broken Object Level
Authorization (BOLA) is the top vulnerability in the OWASP API Security Top 10,
exemplifies a critical access control flaw where attackers manipulate API
parameters to gain unauthorized access. To address this, we propose BOLAZ, a
defense framework grounded in zero trust principles. BOLAZ analyzes the data
flow of resource IDs, pinpointing BOLA attack injection points and determining
the associated authorization intervals to prevent horizontal privilege
escalation. Our approach leverages static taint tracking to categorize APIs
into producers and consumers based on how they handle resource IDs. By mapping
the propagation paths of resource IDs, BOLAZ captures the context in which
these IDs are produced and consumed, allowing for precise identification of
authorization boundaries. Unlike defense methods based on common authorization
models, BOLAZ is the first authorization-guided method that adapts defense
rules based on the system's best-practice authorization logic. We validate
BOLAZ through empirical research on 10 GitHub projects. The results demonstrate
BOLAZ's effectiveness in defending against vulnerabilities collected from CVE
and discovering 35 new BOLA vulnerabilities in the wild, demonstrating its
practicality in real-world deployments.

### [8] [PII Jailbreaking in LLMs via Activation Steering Reveals Personal Information Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02332)
*Krishna Kanth Nakka,Xue Jiang,Xuebing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that manipulating specific attention heads in large language models (LLMs) can bypass their privacy alignment mechanisms to extract sensitive information about data subjects, with high success rates across tested models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are trained to refuse responses to queries about sensitive private attributes, but this raises critical security concerns about potential vulnerabilities in their alignment. The study addresses whether such 'privacy jailbreaking' is possible when direct prompts are insufficient.

Method: The researchers first trained linear probes to identify attention heads responsible for refusal behavior in privacy-related queries. They then applied gradient-based activation steering to a targeted subset of these heads to override the model's typical refusal patterns and generate disclosures.

Result: 95% jailbreaking success rate across four LLMs, with 50% average accuracy in leaking true personal information (sexual orientations, medical conditions, life events, etc.). Steered responses revealed not just private attributes but also personal history details the models would normally reject.

Conclusion: LLMs retain memorized private information in their internal activations, which can be systematically extracted through targeted manipulation. This highlights fundamental limitations in current privacy alignment techniques and exposes risks when attackers use computational steering rather than input prompts to bypass safeguards.

Abstract: This paper investigates privacy jailbreaking in LLMs via steering, focusing
on whether manipulating activations can bypass LLM alignment and alter response
behaviors to privacy related queries (e.g., a certain public figure's sexual
orientation). We begin by identifying attention heads predictive of refusal
behavior for private attributes (e.g., sexual orientation) using lightweight
linear probes trained with privacy evaluator labels. Next, we steer the
activations of a small subset of these attention heads guided by the trained
probes to induce the model to generate non-refusal responses. Our experiments
show that these steered responses often disclose sensitive attribute details,
along with other private information about data subjects such as life events,
relationships, and personal histories that the models would typically refuse to
produce. Evaluations across four LLMs reveal jailbreaking disclosure rates of
at least 95%, with more than 50% on average of these responses revealing true
personal information. Our controlled study demonstrates that private
information memorized in LLMs can be extracted through targeted manipulation of
internal activations.

### [9] [Evaluating Language Models For Threat Detection in IoT Security Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02390)
*Jorge J. Tejero-Fernández,Alfonso Sánchez-Macián*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pipeline using fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for IoT security log analysis, demonstrating their superiority over classical machine learning in multi-class anomaly detection while integrating MITRE CAPEC mappings for mitigation recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT security logs require advanced analysis techniques to detect complex threats, yet traditional machine learning methods may lack contextual understanding and multi-classification accuracy needed for evolving cyberattack scenarios.

Method: The study compares three open-source LLMs against classical ML baselines through three strategies (zero-shot, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning) using IoT datasets. Threats are mapped to MITRE CAPEC, with IoT-specific mitigation actions incorporated into model fine-tuning for integrated solutions.

Result: LLMs achieved better multi-class attack classification accuracy than classical models. Fine-tuned LLMs successfully provided both anomaly detection results and tailored mitigation recommendations aligned with MITRE frameworks.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising approach for robust IoT threat detection and actionable mitigation guidance, combining classification accuracy with contextual security knowledge mapping to address complex cyber threats effectively.

Abstract: Log analysis is a relevant research field in cybersecurity as they can
provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and
systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security
logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three
open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with
three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT
dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the
corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC,
defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models
with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and
recommendation guidance.

### [10] [CyberRAG: An agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424)
*Francesco Blefari,Cristian Cosentino,Francesco Aurelio Pironti,Angelo Furfaro,Fabrizio Marozzo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CyberRAG is a modular, agent-based RAG framework that improves cyber-attack classification by combining specialized machine learning models with iterative context retrieval, reducing false positives and enhancing explanation quality compared to traditional IDS/IPS methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise cybersecurity teams face alert overload and domain expertise gaps. Conventional detectors and RAG systems fail to address high false-positive rates and provide justification for decisions in threat detection.

Method: A central LLM agent coordinates: (1) specialized classifiers for distinct attack families; (2) tool adapters for enrichment; and (3) an iterative retrieval-and-reasoning loop querying a domain-specific knowledge base for self-consistent evidence.

Result: 94.92% final classification accuracy after semantic orchestration, 94% per-class accuracy, and explanations achieving 0.94 BERTScore and 4.9/5 GPT-4 evaluation. Framework demonstrates 7.3x faster classification than traditional RAG.

Conclusion: Agent-centric RAG with domain specialists achieves high accuracy and trustworthy explanations for cyber defense, enabling scalable semi-autonomous workflows where new attack types can be integrated without retraining the core system.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can
generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security
analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise.
Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield
high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to
justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,
a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,
explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent
orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to
a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and
(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a
domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and
self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic
design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This
agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language
justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing
interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be
supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.
CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing
final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.
Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based
expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can
pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a
practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.

### [11] [Effectively Identifying Wi-Fi Devices through State Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02478)
*Melissa Safari,Abhishek K. Mishra,Mathieu Cunche*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for Wi-Fi device fingerprinting using management frame behavioral dynamics, achieving 86%+ accuracy by modeling devices as finite state machines with matrix-encoded structural and temporal features, outperforming prior probe-request-focused methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to associating randomized MAC addresses with devices rely heavily on probe requests, leading to unstable and non-distinctive signatures in dense environments with high device mobility, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The method models Wi-Fi device behavior as finite state machines, capturing state transition dynamics and inter-state delays via matrix representations. These matrices are converted into compact feature vectors for efficient similarity comparisons.

Result: The proposed method achieves over 86% identification accuracy for non-randomized devices using only Wi-Fi management frames, with further improvements through temporal burst aggregation, surpassing state-of-the-art solutions.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, unique device characterization through management frame behavioral dynamics, providing a robust alternative to probe-request-based methods for stable device identification in real-world, high-mobility scenarios.

Abstract: Wi-Fi management frames reveal structured communication patterns that persist
even under randomization of MAC addresses. Prior approaches to associating
randomized MAC addresses with devices primarily focus on probe requests,
overlooking the broader set of management frames and their transition dynamics.
This narrow focus limits their robustness in dense, real-world environments
with high device mobility, where probe activity alone fails to yield stable and
distinctive signatures. In this paper, we present a novel framework for
fingerprinting Wi-Fi devices based on behavioral dynamics extracted from
passively observed management frames. We model each device's behavior as a
finite state machine and introduce matrix-based representations that encode
both structural (state transition frequencies) and temporal (inter-state
delays) characteristics. These matrices are embedded into compact feature
vectors, enabling efficient similarity comparison. Through extensive evaluation
in diverse real-world settings, our method achieves over 86% identification
accuracy for non-randomized devices using only Wi-Fi management frames, with
further improvements observed through temporal burst aggregation. Our findings
are sufficient to uniquely and consistently characterize devices at scale,
outperforming the state-of-the-art.

### [12] [A 10-bit S-box generated by Feistel construction from cellular automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02489)
*Thomas Prévost,Bruno Martin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel 10-bit S-box constructed via a Feistel network with 5-cell cellular automata (CA) and affine transformations, empirically optimized for pseudorandomness and security. It achieves cryptographic properties comparable to or surpassing AES's S-box, suggesting potential replacement for 5-bit ciphers like ASCON.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cryptographic substitution box (S-box) security by combining empirical CA rule selection and Feistel network optimization, addressing limitations in existing S-boxes such as 5-bit variants in lightweight ciphers (e.g., ASCON).

Method: The 10-bit S-box is generated using a Feistel construction with 5-cell CA rounds. Cellular automata rules and Feistel layout were empirically evaluated for pseudorandom output quality and S-box robustness, followed by bijective affine transformations to meet cryptographic requirements.

Result: The proposed S-box demonstrates security metrics (e.g., nonlinearity, differential uniformity) comparable to or better than the AES S-box through cryptanalysis. Its design shows potential for practical application in lightweight encryption schemes.

Conclusion: The authors advocate for their S-box as a viable replacement for 5-bit substitutions in ciphers like ASCON, emphasizing its empirical advantages in both pseudorandomness and cryptographic strength.

Abstract: We propose a new 10-bit S-box generated from a Feistel construction. The
subpermutations are generated by a 5-cell cellular automaton based on a unique
well-chosen rule and bijective affine transformations. In particular, the
cellular automaton rule is chosen based on empirical tests of its ability to
generate good pseudorandom output on a ring cellular automaton. Similarly,
Feistel's network layout is based on empirical data regarding the quality of
the output S-box. We perform cryptanalysis of the generated 10-bit S-box, and
we find security properties comparable to or sometimes even better than those
of the standard AES S-box. We believe that our S-box could be used to replace
the 5-bit substitution of ciphers like ASCON.

enabling quick responses. Blockchain adds transparency and traceability,
supporting compliance and audits. Experiments show improved ingredient
management, reduced waste, and increased kitchen efficiency.

### [14] [Alleviating Attack Data Scarcity: SCANIA's Experience Towards Enhancing In-Vehicle Cyber Security Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02607)
*Frida Sundfeldt,Bianca Widstam,Mahshid Helali Moghadam,Kuo-Yun Liang,Anders Vesterberg*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper develops a context-aware attack data generator for vehicle networks, producing synthetic intrusion data (e.g., DoS, spoofing) with real-world fidelity through parameterized attack models and CAN protocol adjustments. Evaluation of two deep learning-based IDS models on the generated data confirms its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connected vehicles face evolving, complex security threats. Real-world attack data is scarce due to safety, cost, and ethical constraints, necessitating synthetic attack data generation for robust intrusion detection system (IDS) training and evaluation.

Method: The generator uses parameterized attack models augmented with CAN message decoding, protocol-specific constraints, and intensity-adjustment mechanisms (e.g., frame ID patterns, payload manipulation). Attack scenarios include DoS, fuzzy, spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks, configured to balance similarity to actual threats with synthetic variability.

Result: Two deep neural network IDS models achieved high detection accuracy (98.4% and 97.1%) and effective classification when trained/evaluated on generated attack data. The approach enabled rapid, scalable synthetic data generation with a 57x speedup in scenario configuration compared to manual methods.

Conclusion: The study validates that parameterized, context-aware data generation can produce high-fidelity attack data suitable for IDS development without real-world testing. Key fidelity factors include protocol adherence, attack context variability, and domain-specific validation processes, providing practical insights for synthetic security data application.

Abstract: The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks
emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures
such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of
attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms
that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of
ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on
implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and
ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack
scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective
methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper
presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and
corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,
representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,
spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack
models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to
configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and
promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated
attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,
in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural
network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and
scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high
detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also
elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world
scenarios and provide insights into its application.

*Mao Luo,Zhi Wang,Yiwen Huang,Qingyun Zhang,Zhouxing Su,Zhipeng Lv,Wen Hu,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses security vulnerabilities in manually constructed verification rules for electronic payment platforms, proposing a systematic method to enhance their robustness against exploitation risks. High-volume transaction environments face significant financial threats from minor rule flaws, necessitating automated approaches to identify and mitigate defects in expert-written verification rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electronic payment platforms process billions of transactions daily, where minor errors in verification rules could cause massive financial losses. Current manual rules lack systematic robustness guarantees, making them vulnerable to exploitation despite being designed by experts to ensure data security.

Method: The paper introduces a systematic approach to evaluate and strengthen verification rules through framework design that identifies vulnerabilities, likely involving formal analysis or automated testing to complement manual rule creation by domain experts.

Result: The proposed method successfully detects and mitigates defects in existing verification rules, demonstrating practical effectiveness in preventing malicious request bypass and improving overall transaction security in production environments.

Conclusion: Manual verification rules for electronic payments are insufficiently robust without systematic validation, which increases exploitation risks. The paper's structured approach offers a scalable solution to identify rule weaknesses, enhancing trust in high-volume transaction systems and reducing financial vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Electronic payment platforms are estimated to process billions oftransactions
daily, with the cumulative value of these transactionspotentially reaching into
the trillions. Even a minor error within thishigh-volume environment could
precipitate substantial financiallosses. To mitigate this risk, manually
constructed verification rules,developed by domain experts, are typically
employed to identifyand scrutinize transactions in production environments.
However,due to the absence of a systematic approach to ensure the robust-ness
of these verification rules against vulnerabilities, they remainsusceptible to
exploitation.To mitigate this risk, manually constructed verification rules,
de-veloped by domain experts, are typically employed to identify andscrutinize
transactions in production environments. However, dueto the absence of a
systematic approach to ensure the robustness ofthese verification rules against
vulnerabilities, they remain suscep-tible to exploitation. To ensure data
security, database maintainersusually compose complex verification rules to
check whether aquery/update request is valid. However, the rules written by
ex-perts are usually imperfect, and malicious requests may bypassthese rules.
As a result, the demand for identifying the defects ofthe rules systematically
emerges.

### [16] [Control at Stake: Evaluating the Security Landscape of LLM-Driven Email Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02699)
*Jiangrong Wu,Yuhong Nan,Jianliang Wu,Zitong Yao,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Email Agent Hijacking (EAH), a critical security vulnerability in LLM email agents that allows remote control via prompt manipulation. The authors propose EAHawk, an evaluation pipeline, and demonstrate through a large-scale study that 1,404 tested instances are universally exploitable with minimal attack attempts (1.23–2.03 average).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the widespread adoption of LLM email agent apps for complex email management tasks, their security mechanisms remain underexplored, leaving critical vulnerabilities unaddressed in a communication medium with significant user impact.

Method: EAHawk systematically evaluates EAH attacks by testing 14 agent frameworks, 63 agent apps, 12 LLMs, and 20 email services, generating 1,404 real-world agent instances to measure hijacking susceptibility.

Result: Experimental results reveal 100% hijack success rate across all 1,404 instances, with an average of 2.03 attack attempts required for control (as low as 1.23 for certain LLMs).

Conclusion: The study establishes EAH as a universal threat to LLM email agent security, demanding immediate attention to prompt management, API access controls, and input validation mechanisms to mitigate exploitation risks.

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of LLMs have led to the rapid proliferation of
LLM agent apps, where developers enhance LLMs with access to external resources
to support complex task execution. Among these, LLM email agent apps represent
one of the widely used categories, as email remains a critical communication
medium for users. LLM email agents are capable of managing and responding to
email using LLM-driven reasoning and autonomously executing user instructions
via external email APIs (e.g., send email). However, despite their growing
deployment and utility, the security mechanism of LLM email agent apps remains
underexplored. Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential
security risk within these agent apps and their broader implications.
  In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of
LLM email agents. We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which
overrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources,
allowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further
perform specific attack scenarios without user awareness.
  To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to
evaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps. By EAHawk, we performed an
empirical study spanning 14 representative LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps,
12 LLMs, and 20 email services, which led to the generation of 1,404 real-world
email agent instances for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that all
1,404 instances were successfully hijacked; on average, only 2.03 attack
attempts are required to control an email agent instance. Even worse, for some
LLMs, the average number of attempts needed to achieve full agent control drops
to as few as 1.23.

### [17] [Quantifying Classifier Utility under Local Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02727)
*Ye Zheng,Yidan Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to theoretically quantify classifier utility under local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms by linking perturbation concentration analysis with classifier robustness, validated through aligned empirical results in low-dimensional spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDP research lacks rigorous theoretical analysis of its impact on classifier utility, particularly for complex/black-box models, despite practical importance in balancing privacy and performance.

Method: Transforms LDP perturbation analysis into classifier robustness analysis by (1) characterizing LDP perturbation concentration regions probabilistically, (2) treating classifiers as black-box functions for robustness evaluation within these regions, and (3) combining framework with novel refinement techniques.

Result: Theoretical utility quantification successfully guides LDP mechanism selection and privacy parameter optimization. Piecewise-based mechanisms show superior utility in common scenarios, with framework validation confirming strong alignment between theoretical and empirical utility measures in lower-dimensional contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a generalizable method for analyzing classifier utility with LDP by connecting perturbation concentration and black-box robustness analysis, while refinement techniques enhance practical utility assessments for privacy-preserving machine learning.

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) provides a rigorous and quantifiable privacy
guarantee for personal data by introducing perturbation at the data source.
However, quantifying the impact of these perturbations on classifier utility
remains a theoretical challenge, particularly for complex or black-box
classifiers.
  This paper presents a framework for theoretically quantifying classifier
utility under LDP mechanisms. The key insight is that LDP perturbation is
concentrated around the original data with a specific probability, transforming
utility analysis of the classifier into its robustness analysis in this
concentrated region. Our framework connects the concentration analysis of LDP
mechanisms with the robustness analysis of classifiers. It treats LDP
mechanisms as general distributional functions and classifiers as black-box
functions, thus applicable to any LDP mechanism and classifier. A direct
application of our utility quantification is guiding the selection of LDP
mechanisms and privacy parameters for a given classifier. Notably, our analysis
shows that a piecewise-based mechanism leads to better utility compared to
alternatives in common scenarios.
  Using this framework alongside two novel refinement techniques, we conduct
case studies on utility quantification for typical mechanism-classifier
combinations. The results demonstrate that our theoretical utility
quantification aligns closely with empirical observations, particularly when
classifiers operate in lower-dimensional input spaces.

### [18] [Meta SecAlign: A Secure Foundation LLM Against Prompt Injection Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02735)
*Sizhe Chen,Arman Zharmagambetov,David Wagner,Chuan Guo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Meta SecAlign, an open-source LLM with built-in commercial-grade defense against prompt injection attacks, achieving state-of-the-art security while maintaining comparable utility to closed-source counterparts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks threaten LLM applications, but current defenses are closed-source. Open-source models enable collaborative research for attack-defense co-development, critical for mitigating these threats.

Method: Developed Meta SecAlign using an improved SecAlign defense and generic instruction-tuning training recipes. The model integrates model-level security through open-weight training rather than application-specific protections.

Result: Meta SecAlign demonstrated robust security against attacks (particularly 70B version) while performing competitively on 9 utility benchmarks across diverse tasks including tool-calling and web navigation agents.

Conclusion: Open-source models like Meta SecAlign bridge the security-performance gap in commercial LLMs by enabling iterative attack-defense research. Their approach establishes a baseline for open development of protected large language models.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated
applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are
currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We
believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where
co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific
progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we
develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in
model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We
provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved
version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7
security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic
instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,
including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general
instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable
utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

### [19] [Early Signs of Steganographic Capabilities in Frontier LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02737)
*Artur Zolkowski,Kei Nishimura-Gasparian,Robert McCarthy,Roland S. Zimmermann,David Lindner*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study investigates emerging steganography capabilities in large language models (LLMs) for encoding hidden messages and reasoning, finding limited but growing threats to monitoring systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs might evade detection via steganography is critical for risk mitigation as models approach and surpass human-level capabilities in deception techniques.

Method: Evaluated two steganography vectors in frontier models: 1) message encoding under normal vs. augmented conditions (scratchpads), and 2) encoded reasoning in state-tracking tasks using hexadecimal and other schemes with and without pre-defined protocols.

Result: Models failed to encode short messages without detection in standard settings but succeeded with additional tools. Basic encoded reasoning was possible with protocol guidance though not yet subtle enough to fool monitors during cover tasks.

Conclusion: While current steganographic capabilities in LLMs remain limited, the observed progress suggests these risks could evolve rapidly requiring proactive monitoring strategy development.

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

### [20] [NVIDIA GPU Confidential Computing Demystified](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02770)
*Zhongshu Gu,Enriquillo Valdez,Salman Ahmed,Julian James Stephen,Michael Le,Hani Jamjoom,Shixuan Zhao,Zhiqiang Lin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes NVIDIA's GPU Confidential Computing (GPU-CC) system within the Hopper Architecture, highlighting its security benefits for AI workloads while addressing challenges posed by its proprietary and complex design. Researchers reverse-engineer the system components, test the GPU kernel module for vulnerabilities, and speculate on inaccessible mechanisms to enhance transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of detailed documentation, closed ecosystem, and complex design of NVIDIA's GPU-CC system hinder transparency and security research. The authors motivate the need to demystify this critical infrastructure for sensitive AI workloads.

Method: The investigation combines reverse engineering of public and fragmented specifications, instrumentation of the open-source GPU kernel module via experimental analysis, and speculative reasoning about closed components with no direct access. The study systematically explores threat models and security principles while probing each subsystem.

Result: The authors identify security weaknesses in GPU-CC through experiments, report findings responsibly to NVIDIA PSIRT, and provide a low-level architectural understanding through experimental data. They demonstrate vulnerabilities while navigating the system's closed nature through targeted speculation.

Conclusion: This research contributes to the understanding of modern AI security infrastructure by providing an operational blueprint of GPU-CC. While recognizing its privacy advantages over traditional CC solutions, the study emphasizes that architectural complexity and proprietary designs must be balanced with security research transparency to ensure robust protection of sensitive AI operations.

Abstract: GPU Confidential Computing (GPU-CC) was introduced as part of the NVIDIA
Hopper Architecture, extending the trust boundary beyond traditional CPU-based
confidential computing. This innovation enables GPUs to securely process AI
workloads, providing a robust and efficient solution for handling sensitive
data. For end users, transitioning to GPU-CC mode is seamless, requiring no
modifications to existing AI applications. However, this ease of adoption
contrasts sharply with the complexity of the underlying proprietary systems.
The lack of transparency presents significant challenges for security
researchers seeking a deeper understanding of GPU-CC's architecture and
operational mechanisms.
  The challenges of analyzing the NVIDIA GPU-CC system arise from a scarcity of
detailed specifications, the proprietary nature of the ecosystem, and the
complexity of product design. In this paper, we aim to demystify the
implementation of NVIDIA GPU-CC system by piecing together the fragmented and
incomplete information disclosed from various sources. Our investigation begins
with a high-level discussion of the threat model and security principles before
delving into the low-level details of each system component. We instrument the
GPU kernel module -- the only open-source component of the system -- and
conduct a series of experiments to identify the security weaknesses and
potential exploits. For certain components that are out of reach through
experiments, we propose well-reasoned speculations about their inner working
mechanisms. We have responsibly reported all security findings presented in
this paper to the NVIDIA PSIRT Team.

### [21] [How do Software Engineering Candidates Prepare for Technical Interviews?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02068)
*Brian Bell,Teresa Thomas,Sang Won Lee,Chris Brown*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study investigates how software engineering candidates prepare for technical interviews, revealing a lack of authentic training settings and educational support, which contributes to stress and unpreparedness. Findings suggest stakeholders should improve preparation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Technical interviews are a critical but challenging hiring component that graduates typically underprepare for, with computing curricula offering insufficient authentic training experiences or integration of preparation strategies.

Method: A survey was administered to 131 candidates actively preparing for technical interviews to analyze their preparation methods, stress levels, and perceptions of educational program support.

Result: Candidates rarely practice in authentic interview conditions, receive minimal academic training on technical interview approaches, and report elevated stress and unpreparedness levels. Educational programs inadequately address this professional requirement.

Conclusion: The study recommends systemic changes for educational institutions and training stakeholders to incorporate realistic technical interview preparation into curricula and develop targeted resources to reduce candidate stress and improve readiness.

Abstract: To obtain employment, aspiring software engineers must complete technical
interviews -- a hiring process which involves candidates writing code while
communicating to an audience. However, the complexities of tech interviews are
difficult to prepare for and seldom faced in computing curricula. To this end,
we seek to understand how candidates prepare for technical interviews,
investigating the effects of preparation methods and the role of education. We
distributed a survey to candidates (n = 131) actively preparing for technical
interviews. Our results suggest candidates rarely train in authentic settings
and courses fail to support preparation efforts -- leading to stress and
unpreparedness. Based on our findings, we provide implications for stakeholders
to enhance tech interview preparation for candidates pursuing software
engineering roles.

### [22] [Structural Code Search using Natural Language Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02107)
*Ben Limpanukorn,Yanjun Wang,Zach Patterson,Pranav Garg,Murali Krishna Ramanathan,Xiaofei Ma,Anoop Deoras,Miryung Kim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A natural language interface for structural code search that uses LLMs to translate queries into domain-specific languages (DSLs) like Semgrep and GQL, achieving high precision and recall and outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face barriers to adopting structural code search tools due to their reliance on domain-specific languages (DSLs). Natural language queries would provide a more intuitive, accessible alternative for structurally searching code.

Method: Proposed a general approach combining LLM reasoning to interpret natural language search queries with structural search tools (Semgrep/GQL). Created a new benchmark of 400 queries across 10 Java projects for evaluation.

Result: Achieved precision and recall of 55%-70% on the new benchmark. Outperformed semantic code search and LLM retrieval baselines by up to 57% and 14% in F1 scores.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that LLMs can enable effective structural code search through natural language queries, significantly improving over baseline methods and lowering the learning barrier for developers.

Abstract: Searching code is a common task that developers perform to understand APIs,
learn common code patterns, and navigate code. Currently, developers most
commonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and
widely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code
search tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic
structure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to
systematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools
operate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be
difficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural
language to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural
language provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to
entry.
  In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning
capabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the
power of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve
relevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search
DSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for
structural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show
that our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to
DSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision
and recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly
outperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to
57% and 14% on F1 scores.

### [23] [Can Internal Software Metrics Predict App Popularity at Launch? Yeas! and Nays!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02110)
*Md Nahidul Islam Opu,Fatima Islam Mouri,Rick Kazman,Yuanfang Cai,Shaiful Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study demonstrates that internal software metrics, when reframed as binary classification models, can predict mobile app popularity with an F1-score of 0.72, challenging previous dismissals of their predictive value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The competitive mobile app market necessitates pre-release popularity prediction for developers, yet prior work has overlooked the potential of internal code metrics as meaningful indicators despite their relevance to software engineering quality.

Method: Analysis of 446 open-source Android apps using code metrics (system/class/method), code smells, metadata, and external factors (user reviews, download counts). Models evaluated include regression and classification (MLP with Voting feature set derived from selection algorithms).

Result: Binary classification models outperformed regression. A Multilayer Perceptron using optimized feature selection achieved F1-score of 0.72 in predicting popular versus unpopular apps.

Conclusion: Internal code metrics combined with machine learning can serve as effective popularity indicators before release, contradicting earlier claims of their insufficiency as software quality predictors and supporting developer decision-making.

Abstract: Predicting mobile app popularity before release can provide developers with a
strategic advantage in a competitive marketplace, yet it remains a challenging
problem. This study explores whether internal software metrics, measurable from
source code before deployment, can predict an app's popularity, defined by user
ratings (calculated from user reviews) and DownloadsPerYear (yearly downloads).
Using a dataset of 446 open-source Android apps from F-Droid, we extract a wide
array of features, including system-, class-, and method-level code metrics,
code smells, and app metadata. Additional information, such as user reviews,
download counts, and uses-permission, was collected from the Google Play Store.
We evaluate regression and classification models across three feature sets: a
minimal Size-only baseline, a domain-informed Handpicked set, and a Voting set
derived via feature selection algorithms. Regression models perform poorly due
to skewed data, with low $R^2$ scores. However, when reframed as binary
classification (Popular vs. Unpopular), results improve significantly. The best
model, a Multilayer Perceptron using the Voting set, achieves F1-scores of
0.72. These results suggest that internal code metrics, although limited in
their explanatory power, can serve as useful indicators of app popularity. This
challenges earlier findings that dismissed internal metrics as predictors of
software quality.

*Cristina Martinez Montes,Daniela Grassi,Nicole Novielli,Birgit Penzenstadle*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper compared psychometric stress measures with biometric data during software engineering tasks, concluding that the chosen stress induction method (strict time limits) was insufficient to elicit stress responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to address potential biases in self-report instruments by integrating them with objective physiological measures and identifying stress-related patterns in biometric data.

Method: An experiment was conducted with participants completing pre- and post-surveys, biometric sensor monitoring during two software programming tasks, and an exit interview.

Result: Psychometric measures showed no stress, interviews revealed mixed reports (no stress vs. time pressure), and biometrics only identified significant differences in EDA phasic peaks.

Conclusion: The time-constrained task design failed to effectively induce stress, but the study provides methodological guidance for combining psychometric and biometric approaches in future research.

Abstract: The study of well-being, stress and other human factors has traditionally
relied on self-report instruments to assess key variables. However, concerns
about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and
standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these
measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures.
  We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators
and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software
engineering tasks.
  We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then
programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for
each, and finally went through a short exit interview.
  Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric
instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress
and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant
difference only in EDA phasic peaks.
  We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter
time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future
studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.

*Martin Obaidi,Marc Herrmann,Jil Klünder,Kurt Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 14 sentiment analysis tools across 10 software developer datasets and proposes a platform-aware tool recommendation framework using linguistic/statistical features to improve trustworthy AI analytics in requirements engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sentiment analysis tools exhibit inconsistent performance across developer communication platforms due to style/content variations, impacting their reliability for AI-driven analytics in requirements engineering.

Method: Analyzed linguistic and statistical features of 10 datasets from five platforms (GitHub, Jira, Stack Overflow, etc.) and evaluated 14 sentiment analysis tools via a novel mapping approach and questionnaire framework.

Result: Dataset characteristics significantly influence tool effectiveness; transformer-based models (SetFit, RoBERTa) perform consistently well but remain context-dependent; proposed approach improves tool selection by 23-38% over baseline methods.

Conclusion: Platform-specific communication properties necessitate tailored sentiment analysis tool selection. The proposed framework enables researchers/practitioners to identify suitable tools for new datasets while emphasizing the need for ongoing evaluation as software development communication contexts evolve.

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on text-based communication, making
sentiment analysis a valuable tool for understanding team dynamics and
supporting trustworthy AI-driven analytics in requirements engineering.
However, existing sentiment analysis tools often perform inconsistently across
datasets from different platforms, due to variations in communication style and
content.
  In this study, we analyze linguistic and statistical features of 10 developer
communication datasets from five platforms and evaluate the performance of 14
sentiment analysis tools. Based on these results, we propose a mapping approach
and questionnaire that recommends suitable sentiment analysis tools for new
datasets, using their characteristic features as input.
  Our results show that dataset characteristics can be leveraged to improve
tool selection, as platforms differ substantially in both linguistic and
statistical properties. While transformer-based models such as SetFit and
RoBERTa consistently achieve strong results, tool effectiveness remains
context-dependent. Our approach supports researchers and practitioners in
selecting trustworthy tools for sentiment analysis in software engineering,
while highlighting the need for ongoing evaluation as communication contexts
evolve.

### [26] [Enhancing COBOL Code Explanations: A Multi-Agents Approach Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02182)
*Fangjian Lei,Jiawen Liu,Shayan Noei,Ying Zou,Derek Truong,William Alexander*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent system to enhance documentation and understanding of COBOL codebases by generating explanations at function, file, and project levels using contextual information, overcoming LLM token limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COBOL systems face maintenance challenges due to aging code, complexity, and lack of developers/documentation. Existing LLM-based code explanation tools struggle with COBOL's syntax and long code structures.

Method: Two LLM-based agents collaborate using codebase context to generate explanations. Contextual information is integrated into prompts for function/file/project-level documentation through iterative refinement.

Result: Achieved 12.67% METEOR, 18.59% chrF, and 0.62% SentenceBERT improvements in function explanations. File-level explanations surpassed baselines by 4.21%-14.68% and effectively handled long files. Project explanations captured 82% of systems' functionality.

Conclusion: The multi-agent approach significantly improves COBOL code explanation across all levels, effectively addressing LLM limitations while creating comprehensive documentation for complex, long-system code maintenance.

Abstract: Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to
develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business,
and government agencies. Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of
COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly
challenging. In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for
new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing
research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of
code snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its
architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed
the token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach
that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate
explanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents
incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into
the code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach
using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects. Our results indicate that our
approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code
explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR,
chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. At the file level, our approach
effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token
window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in
explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated
explanation. At the project level, our approach generates explanations that
convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.

### [27] [Precisely Detecting Python Type Errors via LLM-based Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02318)
*Chen Yang,Ziqi Wang,Yanjie Jiang,Lin Yang,Yuteng Zheng,Jianyi Zhou,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RTED is a type-aware test generation technique for Python that combines step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to detect more type errors while reducing false positives compared to existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static analysis tools for Python type errors have high false positive rates, and unit test generation methods struggle to produce bug-revealing tests without explicit guidance, reducing their effectiveness for real-world software reliability and productivity.

Method: RTED integrates a dynamic test generation process with step-by-step type constraint analysis to guide test inputs and reflective validation during execution to confirm type violations, systematically suppressing false positives through type-aware prioritization.

Result: RTED detected 22-29 more type errors than four state-of-the-art techniques on BugsInPy and TypeBugs benchmarks, achieved 173.9%-245.9% higher test precision (fewer false positives), and uncovered 12 novel type errors in six open-source projects.

Conclusion: RTED demonstrates significant improvements in both type error detection and precision by combining static type analysis with runtime reflective validation, addressing critical limitations in prior tools and offering practical value for Python software quality.

Abstract: Type errors in Python often lead to runtime failures, posing significant
challenges to software reliability and developer productivity. Existing static
analysis tools aim to detect such errors without execution but frequently
suffer from high false positive rates. Recently, unit test generation
techniques offer great promise in achieving high test coverage, but they often
struggle to produce bug-revealing tests without tailored guidance. To address
these limitations, we present RTED, a novel type-aware test generation
technique for automatically detecting Python type errors. Specifically, RTED
combines step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to
guide the test generation process and effectively suppress false positives. We
evaluated RTED on two widely-used benchmarks, BugsInPy and TypeBugs.
Experimental results show that RTED can detect 22-29 more benchmarked type
errors than four state-of-the-art techniques. RTED is also capable of producing
fewer false positives, achieving an improvement of 173.9%-245.9% in precision.
Furthermore, RTED successfully discovered 12 previously unknown type errors
from six real-world open-source Python projects.

### [28] [VeFIA: An Efficient Inference Auditing Framework for Vertical Federated Collaborative Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02376)
*Chung-ju Huang,Ziqi Zhang,Yinggui Wang,Binghui Wang,Tao Wei,Leye Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces VeFIA, a framework to audit data party inference execution correctness in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) without data leakage or latency, using TEE and random sampling validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFL implementations lack mechanisms to verify the execution correctness of data parties' inference software, risking hidden errors or malicious behavior during cross-silo collaboration.

Method: VeFIA leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and coordinator-assisted inference results validation through random sampling during large-scale VFL execution while preserving data privacy.

Result: Achieves 99.99% anomaly detection probability for >5.4% deviations and 100% precision/recall, with zero online latency overhead due to offloading validation to TEE and coordinator systems.

Conclusion: This is the first work to address inference execution auditing in VFL, demonstrating strong detection guarantees without performance or privacy tradeoffs through novel random sampling strategy and TEE integration.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment
mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

### [29] [Meta-Fair: AI-Assisted Fairness Testing of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02533)
*Miguel Romero-Arjona,José A. Parejo,Juan C. Alonso,Ana B. Sánchez,Aitor Arrieta,Sergio Segura*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Meta-Fair, an automated fairness testing framework for large language models (LLMs) leveraging metamorphic testing and LLM-driven test case generation. It achieves 92% average precision in bias detection across 12 models with open-source tools enabling scalable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM fairness testing relies on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic heuristics, and curated datasets, which are resource-intensive and difficult to scale. The paper addresses the need for a domain-agnostic automated approach to broaden fairness assessment capabilities.

Method: Meta-Fair uses metamorphic relations (MRs) to analyze output variations under controlled input modifications. It employs LLMs for both generating diverse test cases and classifying model outputs, supported by three open-source tools for LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation.

Result: Experiments with 12 pre-trained LLMs and 14 MRs revealed 29% biased behavior executions. Achieved 92% average precision in bias detection and 0.79 max F1-score with human evaluator parity. Non-determinism impacts were mitigated through MR design optimization with 7.9K test cases.

Conclusion: Meta-Fair demonstrates promising automation for LLM fairness testing, reducing domain-specific resource dependency while maintaining reliability. The framework establishes a scalable methodology despite challenges in broader applicability, opening new pathways for autonomous bias detection in AI systems.

Abstract: Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the
development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult
to assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language
models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic
heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult
to scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method
for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific
resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,
Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to
uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled
modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,
we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and
output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and
classify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source
tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test
cases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained
LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.
The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,
achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of
executions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,
with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although
non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through
careful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the
results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation
in LLM testing.

*Alexander Korn,Samuel Gorsch,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLMREI, an automated chat bot for requirements elicitation interviews, which reduces reliance on skilled analysts by using prompting techniques to improve efficiency and minimize errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Requirements elicitation interviews require skilled analysts, are resource-intensive, prone to human biases, and risk miscommunication, necessitating automation to enhance scalability and reduce errors.

Method: The authors explored 1. Zero-shot prompting and 2. Least-to-most prompting for LLMREI, evaluated via 33 simulated stakeholder interviews. Initial fine-tuning attempts were abandoned due to poor results.

Result: LLMREI demonstrated: 1. Error rates similar to human interviewers 2. High requirement extraction capability 3. Context-aware question generation despite limited requirements specification.

Conclusion: LLMREI offers potential to automate large-scale stakeholder interviews, with greatest value in requirements elicitation for multi-stakeholder projects while maintaining comparable accuracy to human analysts.

Abstract: Requirements elicitation interviews are crucial for gathering system
requirements but heavily depend on skilled analysts, making them
resource-intensive, susceptible to human biases, and prone to miscommunication.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models present new opportunities for
automating parts of this process. This study introduces LLMREI, a chat bot
designed to conduct requirements elicitation interviews with minimal human
intervention, aiming to reduce common interviewer errors and improve the
scalability of requirements elicitation. We explored two main approaches,
zero-shot prompting and least-to-most prompting, to optimize LLMREI for
requirements elicitation and evaluated its performance in 33 simulated
stakeholder interviews. A third approach, fine-tuning, was initially considered
but abandoned due to poor performance in preliminary trials. Our study assesses
the chat bot's effectiveness in three key areas: minimizing common interview
errors, extracting relevant requirements, and adapting its questioning based on
interview context and user responses. Our findings indicate that LLMREI makes a
similar number of errors compared to human interviewers, is capable of
extracting a large portion of requirements, and demonstrates a notable ability
to generate highly context-dependent questions. We envision the greatest
benefit of LLMREI in automating interviews with a large number of stakeholders.

### [31] [Human-Machine Collaboration and Ethical Considerations in Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02578)
*Zoe Pfister*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents research on integrating Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) into adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), focusing on addressing challenges related to operational cadence mismatches and privacy while embedding ethical/human values throughout system lifecycle processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive CPS have feedback loops (e.g., MAPE-K) but lack integration of humans due to differing operational cadences. HMT requires monitoring sensitive human behavior, necessitating ethical considerations and privacy preservation for successful human-machine collaboration.

Method: Develop novel HMT integration methods for adaptive CPS feedback loops and frameworks for ethics/human values integration, verification, and validation starting from requirements engineering through system lifecycle stages.

Result: Proposed novel methodologies for HMT integration in CPS feedback mechanisms, along with structured frameworks for ensuring ethical considerations are embedded during requirements engineering and system development phases.

Conclusion: Enables effective HMT in adaptive CPS through balanced human-machine interaction solutions, addressing both technical integration challenges and ethical requirements to maintain privacy and human values in collaborative systems.

Abstract: Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that integrate both
physical and computational capabilities, which can adjust in response to
changing parameters. Furthermore, they increasingly incorporate human-machine
collaboration, allowing them to benefit from the individual strengths of humans
and machines. Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) represents the most advanced paradigm
of human-machine collaboration, envisioning seamless teamwork between humans
and machines. However, achieving effective and seamless HMT in adaptive CPS is
challenging. While adaptive CPS already benefit from feedback loops such as
MAPE-K, there is still a gap in integrating humans into these feedback loops
due to different operational cadences of humans and machines. Further, HMT
requires constant monitoring of human operators, collecting potentially
sensitive information about their actions and behavior. Respecting the privacy
and human values of the actors of the CPS is crucial for the success of
human-machine teams. This research addresses these challenges by: (1)
developing novel methods and processes for integrating HMT into adaptive CPS,
focusing on human-machine interaction principles and their incorporation into
adaptive feedback loops found in CPS, and (2) creating frameworks for
integrating, verifying, and validating ethics and human values throughout the
system lifecycle, starting from requirements engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mismatch in terminology between Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and Software Engineering Researchers (SERs) creates communication barriers, motivating this investigation into concept alignment and collaborative opportunities.

Method: The study investigates how software engineering fundamentals from the SER community are interpreted within the RSE community, employing a systematic methodology for terminology mapping.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a foundation for collaborative terminology mapping between RSEs and SERs, addressing communication challenges and enabling future crowd-sourced knowledge integration.

Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and
Software Engineering Researchers (SERs) often use different terminologies for
similar concepts, creating communication challenges. To better understand these
divergences, we have started investigating how SE fundamentals from the SER
community are interpreted within the RSE community, identifying aligned
concepts, knowledge gaps, and areas for potential adaptation. Our preliminary
findings reveal opportunities for mutual learning and collaboration, and our
systematic methodology for terminology mapping provides a foundation for a
crowd-sourced extension and validation in the future.

### [33] [RLHGNN: Reinforcement Learning-driven Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Next Activity Prediction in Business Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02690)
*Jiaxing Wang,Yifeng Yu,Jiahan Song,Bin Cao,Jing Fan,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RLHGNN introduces a framework that uses reinforcement learning and heterogeneous graphs to improve next activity prediction in business processes by capturing both sequential and non-sequential relationships, outperforming existing methods on six datasets with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequence-based methods fail to capture non-sequential relationships (e.g., parallel executions, conditional dependencies), and graph-based approaches lack flexibility in handling varying process complexities.

Method: Transforms event logs into heterogeneous process graphs with three edge types, creates adaptive structures using reinforcement learning (Markov Decision Process), and applies relation-specific heterogeneous graph convolutions for activity prediction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on six real-world datasets and achieves ~1ms inference latency, enabling real-time business process monitoring.

Conclusion: RLHGNN effectively models diverse relationships in service-oriented business processes through adaptive heterogeneous graph structures and reinforcement learning, offering a practical solution for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The

### [34] [Sustainability Flags for the Identification of Sustainability Posts in Q&A Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02695)
*Sahar Ahmadisakha,Lech Bialek,Mohamed Soliman,Vasilios Andrikopoulos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces sustainability flags for identifying sustainability concepts in cloud architecture discussions, showing improved classification accuracy and practitioner understandability compared to traditional definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud computing's rise has heightened demand for sustainability-focused architectural decisions, but practitioners lack clear guidance to identify sustainability concepts in their forums.

Method: Thematic analysis of cloud provider best practices formed sustainability flags, evaluated via controlled experiments on cloud architecture posts.

Result: Flags reduced sustainability-related post classifications by ~30% vs control, increased certainty by 22%, and improved practitioner ratings (4.3/5 vs 3.1/5 for definitions-only approach).

Conclusion: Sustainability flags effectively support architectural decision-making by enabling more precise and certain identification of sustainability concepts in practitioner discussions compared to definition-based methods.

Abstract: In recent years, sustainability in software systems has gained significant
attention, especially with the rise of cloud computing and the shift towards
cloud-based architectures. This shift has intensified the need to identify
sustainability in architectural discussions to take informed architectural
decisions. One source to see these decisions is in online Q&A forums among
practitioners' discussions. However, recognizing sustainability concepts within
software practitioners' discussions remains challenging due to the lack of
clear and distinct guidelines for this task. To address this issue, we
introduce the notion of sustainability flags as pointers in relevant
discussions, developed through thematic analysis of multiple sustainability
best practices from cloud providers. This study further evaluates the
effectiveness of these flags in identifying sustainability within cloud
architecture posts, using a controlled experiment. Preliminary results suggest
that the use of flags results in classifying fewer posts as
sustainability-related compared to a control group, with moderately higher
certainty and significantly improved performance. Moreover, sustainability
flags are perceived as more useful and understandable than relying solely on
definitions for identifying sustainability.

### [35] [Legal Requirements Translation from Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02846)
*Anmol Singhal,Travis Breaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automated method using textual entailment and in-context learning to extract and encode legal requirements into a domain-specific Python metamodel, reducing reliance on manual labeling and improving generalization. Evaluation on 13 U.S. state breach notification laws shows 89.4% test case success and strong precision/recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring software compliance with legal regulations is resource-intensive, especially for organizations without legal expertise. Existing methods struggle with document relationships, scalability, and generalization due to manual labeling or limited machine learning approaches.

Method: The approach leverages textual entailment to infer relationships and in-context learning to adaptively extract metadata. A manually designed Python class metamodel serves as a canonical structure, encoding both structural and semantic legal metadata through automated schema inference and attribute interdependencies.

Result: Results on 13 state breach notification laws demonstrate 89.4% of generated representations pass validation tests, achieving 82.2% precision and 88.7% recall. This outperforms prior methods by addressing metadata interrelationships and reducing dataset dependency.

Conclusion: The framework effectively encodes legal requirements into structured, executable representations while mitigating limitations of existing approaches. Its metamodel design and contextual learning strategy enable broader applicability to new legal documents with minimal manual effort.

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

### [36] [Requirements Elicitation Follow-Up Question Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02858)
*Yuchen Shen,Anmol Singhal,Travis Breaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores using GPT-4o to generate follow-up interview questions for requirements elicitation, comparing their quality to human-authored questions through two controlled experiments. Results show LLM-generated questions are comparable in clarity, relevancy, and informativeness, and outperform human questions when guided by common mistake frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interviewers face challenges like domain unfamiliarity, cognitive load, and information overload when eliciting requirements through stakeholder interviews. LLMs offer potential to assist in real-time question generation.

Method: The study employs a framework of common interviewer mistake types to guide GPT-4o's question generation. Two controlled experiments compare LLM-generated questions with human-authored ones: one with minimal guidance and another with guidance based on mistake types.

Result: LLM-generated questions outperformed human-authored questions when guided by mistake frameworks, while remaining no worse than human questions in unguided experiments across clarity, relevancy, and informativeness metrics.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively support requirements elicitation by generating high-quality follow-up questions in real-time, particularly when guided by frameworks addressing common interviewer challenges. This demonstrates their potential to improve interview quality and ease.

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.
