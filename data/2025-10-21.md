TL;DR: Hierarchical Multi-Modal Threat Intelligence Fusion (HM-TIF) is a framework for threat detection designed for unaligned, independent security data streams, with a novel temporal correlation protocol and cross-attention mechanisms, achieving 88.7% accuracy and reducing false positives by 32%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security data from different modalities (network, email, system) are typically uncorrelated, with no natural alignment, making it challenging to detect threats across modalities. Existing multi-modal threat detection frameworks assume alignment, which is not typical in real-world operations, leading to operational invalidity.

Method: HM-TIF employs hierarchical cross-attention with dynamic weighting to adapt to varying data availability and threat context, and features a temporal correlation protocol that maintains the statistical independence of the data. The framework can function even with missing modalities or data gaps.

Result: Evaluation on three datasets (UNSW-NB15, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CICBell-DNS2021) shows HM-TIF achieved 88.7% accuracy and a 32% reduction in false positives, compared to existing methods and without requiring aligned multi-modal training data.

Conclusion: The HM-TIF framework provides a practical and effective solution for multi-modal threat detection in real-world scenarios with unaligned data, demonstrating the operational benefits of such an approach and offering deployment guidelines for security teams dealing with heterogeneous and uncoordinated data sources.

Abstract: Multi-modal threat detection faces a fundamental challenge that involves
security tools operating in isolation, and this creates streams of network,
email, and system data with no natural alignment or correlation. We present
Hierarchical Multi-Modal Threat Intelligence Fusion (HM-TIF), a framework
explicitly designed for this realistic scenario where naturally aligned
multi-modal attack data does not exist. Unlike prior work that assumes or
creates artificial alignment, we develop principled methods for correlating
independent security data streams while maintaining operational validity. Our
architecture employs hierarchical cross-attention with dynamic weighting that
adapts to data availability and threat context, coupled with a novel temporal
correlation protocol that preserves statistical independence. Evaluation on
UNSW-NB15, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and CICBell-DNS2021 datasets demonstrates that
HM-TIF achieves 88.7% accuracy with a critical 32% reduction in false positive
rates, even without true multi-modal training data. The framework maintains
robustness when modalities are missing, making it immediately deployable in
real security operations where data streams frequently have gaps. Our
contributions include: (i) the first multi-modal security framework explicitly
designed for non-aligned data, (ii) a temporal correlation protocol that avoids
common data leakage pitfalls, (iii) empirical validation that multi-modal
fusion provides operational benefits even without perfect alignment, and (iv)
practical deployment guidelines for security teams facing heterogeneous,
uncoordinated data sources. Index Terms: multi-modal learning, threat
intelligence, non-aligned data, operational security, cross-attention
