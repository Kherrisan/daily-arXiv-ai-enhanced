Among many downstream tasks,\ngenerating Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits plays a central role in\nvulnerability reproduction, comprehension, and mitigation. While previous\nresearch has focused primarily on zero-day exploitation, the growing\navailability of rich public information accompanying disclosed CVEs leads to a\nnatural question: can LLMs effectively use this information to automatically\ngenerate valid PoCs? In this paper, we present the first empirical study of\nLLM-based PoC generation for web application vulnerabilities, focusing on the\npractical feasibility of leveraging publicly disclosed information. We evaluate\nGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on 100 real-world and reproducible CVEs across three\nstages of vulnerability disclosure: (1) newly disclosed vulnerabilities with\nonly descriptions, (2) 1-day vulnerabilities with patches, and (3) N-day\nvulnerabilities with full contextual code. Our results show that LLMs can\nautomatically generate working PoCs in 8%-34% of cases using only public data,\nwith DeepSeek-R1 consistently outperforming GPT-4o. Further analysis shows that\nsupplementing code context improves success rates by 17%-20%, with\nfunction-level providing 9%-13% improvement than file-level ones. Further\nintegrating adaptive reasoning strategies to prompt refinement significantly\nimproves success rates to 68%-72%. Our findings suggest that LLMs could reshape\nvulnerability exploitation dynamics. To date, 23 newly generated PoCs have been\naccepted by NVD and Exploit DB.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper evaluates the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs, GPT-4o/DeepSeek-R1) to automatically generate Proof-of-Concept (PoC exploits for web vulnerabilities using publicly disclosed information.

Unlike text-only models, VLMs integrate additional modalities,\nintroducing novel vulnerabilities such as image hijacking, which can manipulate\nthe model into producing inappropriate or harmful responses. Drawing\ninspiration from text-based jailbreaks like the \"Do Anything Now\" (DAN)\ncommand, this work introduces VisualDAN, a single adversarial image embedded\nwith DAN-style commands. Specifically, we prepend harmful corpora with\naffirmative prefixes (e.g., \"Sure, I can provide the guidance you need\") to\ntrick the model into responding positively to malicious queries. The\nadversarial image is then trained on these DAN-inspired harmful texts and\ntransformed into the text domain to elicit malicious outputs. Extensive\nexperiments on models such as MiniGPT-4, MiniGPT-v2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA\nreveal that VisualDAN effectively bypasses the safeguards of aligned VLMs,\nforcing them to execute a broad range of harmful instructions that severely\nviolate ethical standards. Our results further demonstrate that even a small\namount of toxic content can significantly amplify harmful outputs once the\nmodel's defenses are compromised.
