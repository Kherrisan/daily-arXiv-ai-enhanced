The core\ndesign of ClusterTag effectively balances the significant mismatch between tag\nencoding space and memory objects: it divides memory objects into multiple\nindependent clusters, thereby limiting tag collisions to finite chunks within\neach cluster. To mitigate tag collisions across clusters, we design a\ncluster-grained heap randomization scheme. This approach introduces random\naddress intervals between clusters and further breaks the entropy limitation of\nthe tag space. ClusterTag has been implemented as an independent memory\nallocator that seamlessly integrates with tag-based sanitizers such as HWASan,\nand maintains comparable performance overhead (within 1%) at various\nrandomization densities.

LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential\nlong-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring,\nmulti-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code\ncomprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase\npipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to\nreason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions,\nincluding 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS).

While formal\nverification offers a principled way to check these properties, the manual\neffort of constructing formal models makes it impractical for large-scale\nanalysis. This paper introduces a key insight: BLE application security\nanalysis can be reframed as a semantic translation problem, i.e., from\nreal-world code to formal models. We leverage large language models (LLMs) not\nto directly detect vulnerabilities, but to serve as translators that convert\nBLE-specific code into process models verifiable by tools like ProVerif. We\nimplement this idea in VerifiaBLE, a system that combines static analysis,\nprompt-guided LLM translation, and symbolic verification to check three core\nsecurity features: encryption, randomness, and authentication. Applied to 1,050\nAndroid BLE apps, VerifiaBLE uncovers systemic weaknesses: only 10.2\\% of apps\nimplement all three protections, while 53.9\\% omit them entirely.
