Test skeletons are especially\nimportant in test-driven development (TDD), where they provide an early\nframework for systematic verification. Traditionally authored manually, their\ncreation can be time-consuming and error-prone, particularly in educational or\nlarge-scale development settings. We evaluate four LLMs -- GPT-4,\nDeepSeek-Chat, Llama4-Maverick, and Gemma2-9B -- on their ability to generate\nRSpec skeletons for a real-world Ruby class developed in a university software\nengineering course. Each model's output is assessed using static analysis and a\nblind expert review to measure structural correctness, clarity,\nmaintainability, and conformance to testing best practices. The study reveals\nkey differences in how models interpret code structure and testing conventions,\noffering insights into the practical challenges of using LLMs for automated\ntest scaffolding. Our results show that DeepSeek generated the most\nmaintainable and well-structured skeletons, while GPT-4 produced more complete\nbut conventionally inconsistent output.
