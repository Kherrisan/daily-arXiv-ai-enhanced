### [1] [Safeguarding Federated Learning-based Road Condition Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12568)
*Sheng Liu,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs) in Federated Learning (FL)-based Road Condition Classification (RCC) systems for autonomous vehicles, proposing a label-distance-based safety metric and a defense mechanism called FLARE to mitigate these attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL-RCC systems face critical vulnerabilities to TLFAs, where malicious vehicles alter labels to compromise road condition safety classification (e.g., mislabeling dangerous roads as safe), but this threat remains underexplored.

Method: 1) Analyzed existing FL-RCC systems' vulnerability to TLFAs; 2) Introduced a novel label-distance-based metric to quantify safety risks; 3) Proposed FLARE, a defense leveraging neuron-wise output layer analysis for TLFA mitigation.

Result: Experiments on three RCC tasks, four metrics, six baselines, and three models demonstrated the severity of TLFAs and FLARE's effectiveness in reducing attack impact, with safety risks quantified via the new metric.

Conclusion: TLFAs pose significant safety threats to FL-RCC systems, but FLARE successfully mitigates them while the proposed metric enables precise risk quantification, enhancing FL-based autonomous driving security.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for
privacy-preserving autonomous driving, specifically camera-based Road Condition
Classification (RCC) systems, harnessing distributed sensing, computing, and
communication resources on board vehicles without sharing sensitive image data.
However, the collaborative nature of FL-RCC frameworks introduces new
vulnerabilities: Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), in which malicious
clients (vehicles) deliberately alter their training data labels to compromise
the learned model inference performance. Such attacks can, e.g., cause a
vehicle to mis-classify slippery, dangerous road conditions as pristine and
exceed recommended speed. However, TLFAs for FL-based RCC systems are largely
missing. We address this challenge with a threefold contribution: 1) we
disclose the vulnerability of existing FL-RCC systems to TLFAs; 2) we introduce
a novel label-distance-based metric to precisely quantify the safety risks
posed by TLFAs; and 3) we propose FLARE, a defensive mechanism leveraging
neuron-wise analysis of the output layer to mitigate TLFA effects. Extensive
experiments across three RCC tasks, four evaluation metrics, six baselines, and
three deep learning models demonstrate both the severity of TLFAs on FL-RCC
systems and the effectiveness of FLARE in mitigating the attack impact.

### [2] [On the Consideration of Vanity Address Generation via Identity-Based Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12670)
*Shogo Murasaki,Kazumasa Omote,Keita Emura*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores generating vanity addresses on blockchain using identity-based signatures (IBS) to overcome ECDSA's limitations while maintaining Ethereum's key recovery mechanisms and gas efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ECDSA-based blockchain addresses require a try-and-error approach to generate vanity addresses, limiting embedded character count. Replacing ECDSA with key recovery mechanisms is impractical for Ethereum's transaction system, necessitating a balanced solution.

Method: The authors construct an IBS scheme from ECDSA with key recovery functionality, leveraging IBS's ability to use arbitrary strings as verification keys for meaningful address customization without full protocol replacement.

Result: The implementation in Solidity demonstrates equivalent gas costs to ECDSA signature verification, proving technical feasibility. While direct vanity address generation is constrained by ECDSA key recovery, IBS enables linking any string to an address through its signature mechanism.

Conclusion: IBS from ECDSA with key recovery offers a practical pathway for customizable addresses (vanity-like) without compromising Ethereum's existing transaction verification system or economic efficiency, demonstrating a viable compatibility solution.

Abstract: An address is indicated as an identifier of the user on the blockchain, and
is defined by a hash value of the ECDSA verification key. A vanity address is
an address that embeds custom characters such as a name. To generate a vanity
address, a classical try-and-error method is employed, and thus the number of
characters to be embedded is limited. In this paper, we focus on the
functionality of identity-based signatures (IBS) where any strings can be
employed as a verification key, and explore whether IBS can be used for
generating a vanity address. We attach importance to the fact that it is not
realistic to replace ECDSA with key recovery, which is currently employed for
issuing transactions in Ethereum, to an IBS scheme. Even if this replacement is
possible, it is not a reasonable price for the ease of the vanity address
generation. Thus, we pay attention to a generic construction of IBS from
signatures, and construct an IBS scheme from ECDSA with key recovery. Though we
cannot directly generate a vanity address due to the key recovery functionality
of the underlying ECDSA, we can connect any string with an address due to the
functionality of IBS that can give additional meaning to the address. We
implement our system by Solidity, and demonstrate that the gas cost is almost
same as that of the ECDSA signature verification.

### [3] [Architectural Backdoors in Deep Learning: A Survey of Vulnerabilities, Detection, and Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12919)
*Victoria Childress,Josh Collyer,Jodie Knapp*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This survey examines architectural backdoors in deep neural networks, which embed malicious logic into computational graphs, evading traditional defenses. It highlights shortcomings in current detection methods and proposes research directions for improving security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural backdoors represent a critical, understudied threat to deep learning systems, persisting through clean retraining and escaping standard security measures, necessitating specialized mitigation strategies.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic consolidation of research on architectural backdoors, covering compiler-level manipulations, AutoML pipeline compromises, supply-chain vulnerabilities, and evaluates emerging detection/defense approaches like static analysis and formal verification.

Result: Despite progress in detection techniques (e.g., static graph inspection), practical and scalable defenses remain lacking, particularly against sophisticated triggers like distributed or stealth backdoor activations.

Conclusion: The survey identifies open challenges in structural backdoor research and advocates for advancing supply-chain security frameworks, cryptographic model attestations, and next-gen benchmarks to develop robust mitigation solutions.

Abstract: Architectural backdoors pose an under-examined but critical threat to deep
neural networks, embedding malicious logic directly into a model's
computational graph. Unlike traditional data poisoning or parameter
manipulation, architectural backdoors evade standard mitigation techniques and
persist even after clean retraining. This survey systematically consolidates
research on architectural backdoors, spanning compiler-level manipulations,
tainted AutoML pipelines, and supply-chain vulnerabilities. We assess emerging
detection and defense strategies, including static graph inspection, dynamic
fuzzing, and partial formal verification, and highlight their limitations
against distributed or stealth triggers. Despite recent progress, scalable and
practical defenses remain elusive. We conclude by outlining open challenges and
proposing directions for strengthening supply-chain security, cryptographic
model attestations, and next-generation benchmarks. This survey aims to guide
future research toward comprehensive defenses against structural backdoor
threats in deep learning systems.

### [4] [Enterprise Security Incident Analysis and Countermeasures Based on the T-Mobile Data Breach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12937)
*Zhuohan Cui,Zikun Song*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study analyzes T-Mobile's 2021/2023 data breaches through hands-on security testing and proposes cost-effective defenses validated by financial modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the urgent need for telecom providers to achieve operational resilience against escalating data breach risks while maintaining regulatory compliance.

Method: Combined case-based vulnerability assessments with practical ethical hacking (Shodan reconnaissance, API misuse simulations, VNC brute-forcing, firmware reverse engineering, web application scans) and economic analysis.

Result: Identified persistent architectural weaknesses, developed multi-layered security framework (Zero Trust, RBAC, network segmentation, AES firmware encryption, API rate limiting), and proved cost-effectiveness through 5-year financial modeling showing losses would be 89 times higher without proactive measures.

Conclusion: Provides an actionable security blueprint for large telecoms to enhance breach prevention through integrated forensic analysis and hands-on security evaluation, demonstrating proactive measures' value for threat readiness and compliance.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of T-Mobile's critical data
breaches in 2021 and 2023, alongside a full-spectrum security audit targeting
its systems, infrastructure, and publicly exposed endpoints. By combining
case-based vulnerability assessments with active ethical hacking
techniques--including Shodan reconnaissance, API misuse simulations, VNC
brute-forcing, firmware reverse engineering, and web application scans--we
uncover structural weaknesses persisting beyond the initial breach events.
Building on these findings, we propose a multi-layered defensive strategy
encompassing Zero Trust Architecture, granular role-based access control,
network segmentation, firmware encryption using AES with integrity checks, and
API rate limiting and token lifecycle control. Financial modelling demonstrates
that a five-year investment yields less than 1.1% of expected breach losses,
validating the cost-effectiveness of proactive security measures. Our work
bridges post-incident forensic analysis with hands-on security evaluation,
providing an actionable blueprint for large-scale telecoms seeking operational
resilience, regulatory compliance, and cross-domain threat readiness.

### [5] [Measuring CEX-DEX Extracted Value and Searcher Profitability: The Darkest of the MEV Dark Forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13023)
*Fei Wu,Danning Sui,Thomas Thiery,Mallesh Pai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study analyzes CEX-DEX arbitrage on Ethereum over 19 months, finding significant MEV extraction (233.8M USD) and increasing centralization, with top 3 searchers controlling 75% of volume and profits. It reveals searcher-builder integration dynamics and underestimated builder profits where vertical integration occurs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand economic dynamics of cross-exchange arbitrage in Ethereum's MEV landscape to quantify its impact on decentralization, addressing limitations in prior methods for measuring arbitrage revenue without CEX behavioral data.

Method: Developed refined heuristics for identifying arbitrage transactions from on-chain data and created an empirical framework estimating arbitrage revenue through 7.2 million transaction observations over August 2023-March 2025, incorporating analysis of searcher-builder integration patterns.

Result: 1. 233.8M USD extracted by 19 major searchers
2. Top 3 searchers captured 75% of volume/value
3. Searcher profitability correlated with builder integration
4. Discovered exclusive searcher-builder relationships affecting market dynamics
5. Corrected MEV estimates showing_builder profits from vertical integration may be 21% higher than previously thought.

Conclusion: The findings underscore growing centralization in Ethereum MEV practices, demonstrate how searcher-builder partnerships shape market outcomes, and reveal significant underestimation of vertically integrated_builder profits. This highlights systemic risks to Ethereum's decentralized ethos through exploitative arbitrage strategies.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of the economics and
dynamics behind arbitrages between centralized and decentralized exchanges
(CEX-DEX) on Ethereum. We refine heuristics to identify arbitrage transactions
from on-chain data and introduce a robust empirical framework to estimate
arbitrage revenue without knowing traders' actual behaviors on CEX. Leveraging
an extensive dataset spanning 19 months from August 2023 to March 2025, we
estimate a total of 233.8M USD extracted by 19 major CEX-DEX searchers from
7,203,560 identified CEX-DEX arbitrages. Our analysis reveals increasing
centralization trends as three searchers captured three-quarters of both volume
and extracted value. We also demonstrate that searchers' profitability is tied
to their integration level with block builders and uncover exclusive
searcher-builder relationships and their market impact. Finally, we correct the
previously underestimated profitability of block builders who vertically
integrate with a searcher. These insights illuminate the darkest corner of the
MEV landscape and highlight the critical implications of CEX-DEX arbitrages for
Ethereum's decentralization.

### [6] [From Paranoia to Compliance: The Bumpy Road of System Hardening Practices on Stack Exchange](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13028)
*Niklas Busch,Philip Klostermeyer,Jan H. Klemmer,Yasemin Acar,Sascha Fahl*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study examines system operators' challenges and practices in cyberattack hardening through 316 Stack Exchange posts, identifying access control and deployment issues, misconceptions, and motivations like fear of attacks or compliance needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding in the research community regarding system operators' motivations and challenges in hardening systems against cyberattacks, aiming to improve system security practices.

Method: Qualitative analysis of 316 Stack Exchange (SE) posts related to system hardening, focusing on practices and challenges.

Result: Key challenges include access control and deployment issues; operators often have misconceptions and unrealistic expectations. Posts mainly addressed operating systems and server applications, with motivations linked to fear of attacks or compliance.

Conclusion: The study discusses research questions, provides recommendations for future system hardening strategies, and highlights implications for enhancing operator practices and system security frameworks.

Abstract: Hardening computer systems against cyberattacks is crucial for security.
However, past incidents illustrated, that many system operators struggle with
effective system hardening. Hence, many computer systems and applications
remain insecure. So far, the research community lacks an in-depth understanding
of system operators motivation, practices, and challenges around system
hardening. With a focus on practices and challenges, we qualitatively analyzed
316 Stack Exchange (SE) posts related to system hardening. We find that access
control and deployment-related issues are the most challenging, and system
operators suffer from misconceptions and unrealistic expectations. Most
frequently, posts focused on operating systems and server applications. System
operators were driven by the fear of their systems getting attacked or by
compliance reasons. Finally, we discuss our research questions, make
recommendations for future system hardening, and illustrate the implications of
our work.

### [7] [MAD-Spear: A Conformity-Driven Prompt Injection Attack on Multi-Agent Debate Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13038)
*Yu Cui,Hongyang Du*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MAD-Spear is a targeted prompt injection attack that exploits LLM agents' conformity tendencies in multi-agent debate systems, significantly degrading consensus quality while demonstrating the security risks and performance impacts of adversarial agent manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the understudied security vulnerabilities in multi-agent debate (MAD) systems, where prior research focused on accuracy/scalability but overlooked fault-tolerance and robustness against adversarial attacks.

Method: 1. Designed MAD-Spear: Composes prompt injection attacks with communication strategies to manipulate a subset of agents (via plausible incorrect responses) and exploit conformity in LLMs.
2. Proposed a formal definition of MAD fault-tolerance and an evaluation framework assessing accuracy, consensus efficiency, and scalability under attacks.

Result: 1. MAD-Spear consistently outperforms baseline attacks in degrading system performance across 5 benchmark datasets of varying difficulty.
2. Agent diversity significantly improves mathematical reasoning task performance, contradicting previous claims of minimal impact on MAD systems.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates critical security weaknesses in MAD systems and highlights the necessity of rethinking MAD architectures to incorporate robust fault-tolerance mechanisms while leveraging agent diversity for performance improvements.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) systems leverage collaborative interactions among
large language models (LLMs) agents to improve reasoning capabilities. While
recent studies have focused on increasing the accuracy and scalability of MAD
systems, their security vulnerabilities have received limited attention. In
this work, we introduce MAD-Spear, a targeted prompt injection attack that
compromises a small subset of agents but significantly disrupts the overall MAD
process. Manipulated agents produce multiple plausible yet incorrect responses,
exploiting LLMs' conformity tendencies to propagate misinformation and degrade
consensus quality. Furthermore, the attack can be composed with other
strategies, such as communication attacks, to further amplify its impact by
increasing the exposure of agents to incorrect responses. To assess MAD's
resilience under attack, we propose a formal definition of MAD fault-tolerance
and develop a comprehensive evaluation framework that jointly considers
accuracy, consensus efficiency, and scalability. Extensive experiments on five
benchmark datasets with varying difficulty levels demonstrate that MAD-Spear
consistently outperforms the baseline attack in degrading system performance.
Additionally, we observe that agent diversity substantially improves MAD
performance in mathematical reasoning tasks, which challenges prior work
suggesting that agent diversity has minimal impact on performance. These
findings highlight the urgent need to improve the security in MAD design.

### [9] [Prompt Injection 2.0: Hybrid AI Threats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13169)
*Jeremy McHugh,Kristina Šekrst,Jon Cefalu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how modern prompt injection attacks combine with web vulnerabilities like XSS/CSRF to bypass security measures, proposing hybrid threat detection and architectural solutions for AI-enhanced attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks have evolved with agentic AI systems, combining traditional cyber exploits to systematically evade security controls, creating critical threats requiring advanced mitigation strategies.

Method: The study evaluates prompt injection attacks' integration with XSS, CSRF, and other web vulnerabilities using recent benchmarks to test existing security tools (e.g., WAFs, filters, tokens). It proposes architectural solutions combining prompt isolation, runtime security, privilege separation, and novel threat detection.

Result: Demonstrated failure of traditional web security controls against AI-enhanced attacks; proposed solutions integrating multi-layered security mechanisms and hybrid threat detection show improved resilience to these evolving threats.

Conclusion: The research confirms the necessity of combining modern security architecture elements with AI-specific threat detection to address hybrid cyber-AI attacks, building upon foundational work while establishing new benchmarks for mitigation effectiveness.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks, where malicious input is designed to manipulate AI
systems into ignoring their original instructions and following unauthorized
commands instead, were first discovered by Preamble, Inc. in May 2022 and
responsibly disclosed to OpenAI. Over the last three years, these attacks have
continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The
emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep
tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally
transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now
combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that
systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections
integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),
and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures.
We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies,
evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent
infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent
benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS
filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present
architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and
privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.

centralized federated learning (CFL), and DFL across different node counts,
topologies, and data distributions. Results show that DFL maintains competitive
performance while preserving data locality, outperforming CFL in most settings.
This dataset provides a solid foundation for studying the security of IoT
crowdsensing environments.

pervasive, their application to various Artificial Intelligence for IT
Operations (AIOps) tasks has garnered significant attention. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the impact, potential, and limitations of LLMs
in AIOps remains in its infancy. To address this gap, we conducted a detailed

LLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new
data sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks,
highlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across
these tasks. RQ3 investigates the various LLM-based methods applied to address
AIOps challenges. Finally, RQ4 reviews evaluation methodologies tailored to
assess LLM-integrated AIOps approaches. Based on our findings, we discuss the
state-of-the-art advancements and trends, identify gaps in existing research,
and propose promising directions for future exploration.

### [12] [LLM-Powered Quantum Code Transpilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12480)
*Nazanin Siavash,Armin Moin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated transpilers to address interoperability challenges between Quantum SDKs (QSDKs), eliminating the need for rigid, rule-based mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum SDKs (QSDKs) vary across platforms, creating barriers to cross-platform development for hybrid quantum-classical systems. Rule-based transpilers are labor-intensive, requiring expertise and inflexible mappings for accurate code translation between QSDKs.

Method: The authors explore LLMs as language-agnostic transpilers, leveraging their pre-trained knowledge and contextual reasoning to convert quantum programs between QSDKs while maintaining functional equivalence, without manual transformation rules.

Result: The approach demonstrates scalable quantum software portability by automating code translation between QSDKs, achieving functional equivalence without explicitly defined rules or platform-specific rigid mappings.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a general-purpose, intelligent solution for quantum transpilation, advancing cross-platform development and reducing reliance on expertise for maintaining interoperability in quantum computing ecosystems.

Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different
quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples
include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this
diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and
cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems.
Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are
time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid
mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution.
Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we
position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of
converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving
functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined
transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software
portability. This work represents a step toward enabling intelligent,
general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem.

*Ishraq Khan,Assad Chowdary,Sharoz Haseeb,Urvish Patel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Kodezi Chronos is a next-gen architecture for autonomous code understanding/debugging, overcoming inference-time context limits through multi-level embedding memory and graph-based indexing, achieving 23% better bug detection and 40% fewer debugging cycles. Natively integrates with IDEs/CI/CD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in handling large codebases due to limited context length and inability to reason about explicit code structures, hindering effective software maintenance and debugging.

Method: Utilizes multi-level embedding memory engine with vector/graph-based indexing, continuous code-aware retrieval, and repository-scale comprehension capabilities to process ultra-long contexts across codebases/histories/documentation.

Result: Chronos demonstrates 23% improvement in real-world bug detection accuracy and reduces debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional LLMs/code models using the new Multi Random Retrieval benchmark.

Conclusion: Kodezi Chronos represents a critical step toward self-sustaining software ecosystems by enabling autonomous code maintenance with native IDE/CI/CD integration, achieving state-of-the-art results in complex code task resolution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software
automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context
and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a
next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and
maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire
codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits.
Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining
vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This
enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code,
supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and
real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random
Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain.
Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to
resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts,
simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and
semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models,
demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing
debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based
approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos
enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability
and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical
advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

### [14] [A Survey of Reinforcement Learning for Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12483)
*Dong Wang,Hanmo You,Lingwei Zhu,Kaiwei Lin,Zheng Chen,Chen Yang,Junji Yu,Zan Wang,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents the first systematic survey of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) applications in software engineering since 2015, analyzing 115 peer-reviewed studies from top venues to identify trends, methods, datasets, and evaluation practices while addressing open challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing system complexity and automation demands in software engineering (SE) have driven researchers to apply RL/DRL to tasks like design, development, and maintenance. However, no comprehensive review exists to synthesize advancements, challenges, or opportunities in this dynamic field.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic mapping and review of 115 publications across 22 top SE conferences/journals since 2015. They classified studies based on SE areas, RL algorithms, dataset usage, model design, optimization approaches, and evaluation practices.

Result: The analysis reveals publication trends in RL/DRL for SE, categorizes applications (e.g., code generation, testing, maintenance), highlights prevalent algorithms and challenges, and exposes gaps in dataset sharing, model interpretability, and evaluation consistency.

Conclusion: This survey provides a foundational roadmap for RL/DRL in SE, offering actionable insights for researchers and practitioners to advance algorithmic innovation, data practices, and evaluation standards in this nascent domain.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for sequential
decision-making and has attracted growing interest across various domains,
particularly following the advent of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in 2015.
Simultaneously, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
further fueled interest in integrating RL with LLMs to enable more adaptive and
intelligent systems. In the field of software engineering (SE), the increasing
complexity of systems and the rising demand for automation have motivated
researchers to apply RL to a broad range of tasks, from software design and
development to quality assurance and maintenance. Despite growing research in
RL-for-SE, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic survey of
this evolving field. To address this gap, we reviewed 115 peer-reviewed studies
published across 22 premier SE venues since the introduction of DRL. We
conducted a comprehensive analysis of publication trends, categorized SE topics
and RL algorithms, and examined key factors such as dataset usage, model design
and optimization, and evaluation practices. Furthermore, we identified open
challenges and proposed future research directions to guide and inspire ongoing
work in this evolving area. To summarize, this survey offers the first
systematic mapping of RL applications in software engineering, aiming to
support both researchers and practitioners in navigating the current landscape
and advancing the field. Our artifacts are publicly available:

### [15] [When Retriever Meets Generator: A Joint Model for Code Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12558)
*Tien P. T. Le,Anh M. T. Bui,Huy N. D. Pham,Alessio Bucaioni,Phuong T. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RAGSum is a unified code comment generation framework that tightly couples retrieval and generation using CodeT5. It employs contrastive pre-training for embeddings, joint training with composite losses, and a self-refinement loop, achieving state-of-the-art performance across Java, Python, and C benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods optimize retrieval and comment generation separately, leading to noisy results from irrelevant code snippets. This paper addresses the need for holistic optimization to improve comment automation effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: RAGSum uses a single CodeT5 architecture with contrastive pre-training to enhance embedding quality for nearest-neighbor retrieval, followed by joint end-to-end training combining top-k retrieval accuracy and generation error minimization. A lightweight self-refinement mechanism refines outputs iteratively.

Result: Evaluation on three cross-language (Java/Python/C) datasets shows RAGSum outperforms established baselines by margins of +5.2 in BLEU-4, +7.8 in METEOR, and +9.1 in ROUTE-L, demonstrating superior effectiveness of integrated retrieval-generation approaches.

Conclusion: Tight integration of retrieval and generation raises comment automation ceilings, validates joint optimization of both components, and motivates future work including replication studies and developer-focused qualitative analysis to solidify these findings.

Abstract: Automatically generating concise, informative comments for source code can
lighten documentation effort and accelerate program comprehension.
Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments
and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically
optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise
downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with
the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is
built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We
report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on
CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for
nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a
composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes
comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop
is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three
cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three
well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially
outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These
findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the
ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and
qualitative developer studies.

### [16] [ROSE: Transformer-Based Refactoring Recommendation for Architectural Smells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12561)
*Samal Nursapa,Anastassiya Samuilova,Alessio Bucaioni. Phuong T. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes using transformer-based models like CodeBERT and CodeT5 for recommending refactorings to fix architectural smells, achieving high accuracy and F1 scores, and releases code/data for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing software architectural smell detection tools lack actionable repair suggestions, creating a gap between problem identification and resolution.

Method: Fine-tuned CodeBERT and CodeT5 on ~2 million refactoring examples from 11,149 Java projects, framing the task as three-class classification.

Result: CodeT5 achieved 96.9% accuracy and 95.2% F1 score for smell repair recommendations, surpassing CodeBERT and traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Transformer models effectively enable end-to-end architectural smell detection and repair, establishing a reproducible foundation for future refactoring recommendation systems.

Abstract: Architectural smells such as God Class, Cyclic Dependency, and Hub-like
Dependency degrade software quality and maintainability. Existing tools detect
such smells but rarely suggest how to fix them. This paper explores the use of
pre-trained transformer models--CodeBERT and CodeT5--for recommending suitable
refactorings based on detected smells. We frame the task as a three-class
classification problem and fine-tune both models on over 2 million refactoring
instances mined from 11,149 open-source Java projects. CodeT5 achieves 96.9%
accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines. Our
results show that transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap
between smell detection and actionable repair, laying the foundation for future
refactoring recommendation systems. We release all code, models, and data under
an open license to support reproducibility and further research.

### [17] [QSpark: Towards Reliable Qiskit Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12642)
*Kiana Kheiri,Aamna Aamir,Andriy Miranskyy,Chen Ding*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper improves AI-assisted quantum programming by fine-tuning a 32B model with GRPO and ORPO reinforcement learning methods on quantum code. ORPO achieves 56.29% Pass@1 on Qiskit HumanEval, surpassing prior baselines and showing strong performance on intermediate tasks, while GRPO excels at basic tasks but both methods highlight limitations in handling advanced quantum programming tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum circuits require error resilience, but existing LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and StarCoder frequently produce flawed Qiskit code. This creates a clear need for specialized training approaches to enhance quantum programming capabilities in AI models.

Method: The authors fine-tuned a 32B language model using two reinforcement learning strategies: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for basic task mastery and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) for intermediate task improvement. They employed a richly annotated synthetic quantum code dataset for training and evaluation.

Result: ORPO achieved 56.29% Pass@1 on Qiskit HumanEval (a +10 percentage point improvement over Granite-8B-QK) and 65.90% on original HumanEval. GRPO reached 49% Pass@1 on Qiskit HumanEval and 63.00% on original HumanEval, outperforming general-purpose baselines but underperforming ORPO on intermediate tasks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates significant progress in quantum-specific code generation (42/54 basic and 41/68 intermediate task success) but reveals limitations in handling advanced tasks. This highlights both the potential and current constraints of AI-assisted quantum programming, suggesting focused improvements are needed for more sophisticated applications.

Abstract: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and
StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned a 32 B model with two
RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference
Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit
HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29\% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over
Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49\%, both beating all general-purpose baselines;
on the original HumanEval they score 65.90\% and 63.00\%. GRPO excels on basic
tasks (42/54), ORPO on intermediate ones (41/68), and neither solves the five
advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted
quantum programming.

### [18] [A Three-Phase Evaluation Approach for new Information and Data Models in the Smart Grid Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12649)
*Christine van Stiphoudt,Sergio Potenciano Menci,Gilbert Fridgen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a three-phase evaluation approach combining explicit and implicit methods to assess newly designed information/data models in smart grids during their development, using industrial flexibility descriptions as a test case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The digitalization of smart grids is increasing automated data exchanges, but flaws in new information/data models risk causing operational disruptions. Current evaluation methods either lack defined steps (explicit approaches outside smart grids) or focus only on testing existing models (implicit smart grid approaches).

Method: The researchers used design science research methodology to develop a three-phase evaluation approach. They validated this method by creating and refining information/data models for industrial flexibility descriptions in smart grids through iterative design phases.

Result: The three-phase evaluation approach successfully combined explicit theoretical assessment with implicit practical testing of smart grid models. They produced an industrial flexibility information/data model and documented implementation lessons learned.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a structured evaluation methodology that bridges the gap between theoretical assessment and practical system integration for smart grid data models, enabling early detection of flaws to prevent operational disruptions. The approach remains applicable to other information/data model development contexts.

Abstract: The ongoing digitalisation of the smart grid is resulting in an increase in
automated information exchanges across distributed energy systems. This process
has led to the development of new information and data models when the existing
ones fall short. To prevent potential disruptions caused by flaws in the newly
designed information and data models, it is essential to evaluate them during
the design process before they are implemented in operation.
  Currently, general explicit evaluation approaches outside the smart grid
domain stay at a high level without defining clear steps. Meanwhile, implicit
evaluation approaches in the smart grid domain focus on testing systems that
utilise information and data models already in use for functionality in terms
of conformance and interoperability. Notably, no combination of explicit and
implicit evaluation approaches for newly designed information and data models
offers a clearly defined set of steps during their design process in the smart
grid context.
  Consequently, we design a three-phase evaluation approach using design
science research to address this gap. Our evaluation approach combines explicit
and implicit evaluation methods and is applicable when developing new
information and data models. We use the development of an information model and
data model focused on industrial flexibility descriptions to refine our
evaluation approach. Additionally, we provide lessons learned from our
experience.

### [19] [A Fuzzy Approach to Project Success: Measuring What Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12653)
*João Granja-Correia,Remedios Hernández-Linares,Luca Ferranti,Arménio Rego*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system to evaluate project success by prioritizing sustained end-user impact over traditional Likert-scale measures and secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Likert-scale measures oversimplify project success, ignoring context-dependent factors and multifaceted criteria such as sustained user impact vs. transient stakeholder metrics.

Method: A hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy logic system was developed to dynamically weigh primary (end-user impact) and secondary (stakeholder satisfaction, internal success) success factors with context-aware prioritization.

Result: The theoretical framework demonstrated potential for more accurate project success evaluation through context-sensitive, user-centric fuzzy logic analysis rather than rigid static scoring.

Conclusion: This fuzzy logic approach offers an adaptable tool for complex project success assessments, with future work needed to validate the model through empirical studies and social science applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to project success evaluation by
integrating fuzzy logic into an existing construct. Traditional Likert-scale
measures often overlook the context-dependent and multifaceted nature of
project success. The proposed hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system
prioritizes sustained positive impact for end-users, reducing emphasis on
secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction and internal project success.
This dynamic approach may provide a more accurate measure of project success
and could be adaptable to complex evaluations. Future research will focus on
empirical testing and broader applications of fuzzy logic in social science.

### [20] [Single Conversation Methodology: A Human-Centered Protocol for AI-Assisted Software Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12665)
*Salvador D. Escobedo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a structured software development approach using LLMs through a single, long-context conversation, emphasizing cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practices passively rely on ad hoc LLM interactions, necessitating a correction to reassert the developer's active role as architect and supervisor.

Method: SCM defines phases, best practices, and philosophical principles for a structured dialogue with LLMs across all project stages, from requirements to implementation.

Result: Presentation of SCM as a framework to improve LLM-based software development through structured conversation and developer agency.

Conclusion: SCM provides a necessary shift toward active developer engagement with LLMs, ensuring better traceability and documentation in the development process.

Abstract: We propose the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a novel and pragmatic
approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). In
contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured
and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from
requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single,
long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of
cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its
phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers
a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current
practices. We aim to reassert the active role of the developer as architect and
supervisor of the intelligent tool.

### [21] [Investigating the Performance of Small Language Models in Detecting Test Smells in Manual Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13035)
*Keila Lucas,Rohit Gheyi,Márcio Ribeiro,Fabio Palomba,Luana Martins,Elvys Soares*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using Small Language Models (SLMs) to detect and improve test smells in manual test cases, finding Phi-4 achieves 97% pass@2 detection while offering low-cost, concept-based solutions for Ubuntu test cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual test cases suffer from test smells like ambiguity, redundancy, and missing checks that reduce reliability and maintainability. Existing detection tools require time-consuming rule definitions and lack scalability.

Method: Evaluated 3 SLMs (Gemma3, Llama3.2, Phi-4) on 143 real Ubuntu test cases for 7 test smell types. Analyzed detection accuracy, explanation capabilities, and improvement suggestions without explicit instructions.

Result: Phi-4 detected test smells in sentences with 97% pass@2 accuracy. Gemma3 and Llama3.2 achieved ~91%. All models autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements, achieving concept-driven detection without extensive rules or syntax analysis.

Conclusion: SLMs provide scalable, cost-effective test smell detection with interpretation benefits while maintaining data privacy. The results demonstrate they outperform rule-based approaches for real-world manual testing quality improvement.

Abstract: Manual testing, in which testers follow natural language instructions to
validate system behavior, remains crucial for uncovering issues not easily
captured by automation. However, these test cases often suffer from test
smells, quality issues such as ambiguity, redundancy, or missing checks that
reduce test reliability and maintainability. While detection tools exist, they
typically require manual rule definition and lack scalability. This study
investigates the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) for automatically
detecting test smells. We evaluate Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4 on 143
real-world Ubuntu test cases, covering seven types of test smells. Phi-4
achieved the best results, reaching a pass@2 of 97% in detecting sentences with
test smells, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 reached approximately 91%. Beyond
detection, SLMs autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements, even
without explicit prompt instructions. They enabled low-cost, concept-driven
identification of diverse test smells without relying on extensive rule
definitions or syntactic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of
SLMs as efficient tools that preserve data privacy and can improve test quality
in real-world scenarios.

### [22] [iReDev: A Knowledge-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Intelligent Requirements Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13081)
*Dongming Jin,Weisong Sun,Jiangping Huang,Peng Liang,Jifeng Xuan,Yang Liu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes iReDev, a knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirements development that integrates human knowledge and event-driven collaboration mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Requirements development is typically labor-intensive and conflict-prone, with existing multi-agent systems lacking sufficient support for this phase and overlooking human knowledge injection and collaboration.

Method: iReDev utilizes six knowledge-driven agents working with an artifact pool for event-based communication, enabling dynamic requirement handling, and incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism for stakeholder alignment.

Result: Evaluation of generated artifacts demonstrated iReDev's superiority over existing baselines in multiple performance aspects.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses human-agent collaboration and rapid requirement updates while proposing three future research directions to advance intelligent requirements development.

Abstract: Requirements development is a critical phase as it is responsible for
providing a clear understanding of what stakeholders need. It involves
collaboration among stakeholders to extract explicit requirements and address
potential conflicts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently,
multi-agent systems for software development have attracted much attention.
However, existing research provides limited support for requirements
development and overlooks the injection of human knowledge into agents and the
human-agent collaboration. % To address these issues, this paper proposes a
knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development,
named iReDev. iReDev features: iReDev consists of six knowledge-driven agents
to support the entire requirements development. They collaboratively perform
various tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses
on integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world
stakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an
artifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger
the next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new
requirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to
support human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align
with the expectations of stakeholders. We evaluated the generated artifacts and
results show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in multiple aspects. We
further envision three key directions and hope this work can facilitate the
development of intelligent requirements development.

*Dongming Jin,Zhi Jin,Linyu Li,Xiaohong Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of requirements engineering in software systems powered by large pretrained models, proposing a conceptual framework and research directions for the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of large pretrained models introduces ambiguous capability boundaries, context-dependent behavior, and continuous evolution, which contradict traditional requirements engineering assumptions like functional decomposability and behavioral predictability.

Method: The authors conduct an investigative analysis of the emerging characteristics in model-enabled systems and propose a tailored conceptual framework for requirements engineering.

Result: A conceptual framework was developed for requirements engineering in pretrained-model-enabled systems, with several promising research directions identified.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a vision and guiding framework for researchers and practitioners to adapt requirements engineering methodologies to the unique characteristics of model-driven software systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large pretrained models have led to their widespread
integration as core components in modern software systems. The trend is
expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Unlike traditional software
systems governed by deterministic logic, systems powered by pretrained models
exhibit distinctive and emergent characteristics, such as ambiguous capability
boundaries, context-dependent behavior, and continuous evolution. These
properties fundamentally challenge long-standing assumptions in requirements
engineering, including functional decomposability and behavioral
predictability. This paper investigates this problem and advocates for a
rethinking of existing requirements engineering methodologies. We propose a
conceptual framework tailored to requirements engineering of
pretrained-model-enabled software systems and outline several promising
research directions within this framework. This vision helps provide a guide
for researchers and practitioners to tackle the emerging challenges in
requirements engineering of pretrained-model-enabled systems.

### [24] [Inferring Attributed Grammars from Parser Implementations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13117)
*Andreas Pointner,Josef Pichler,Herbert Prähofer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a new approach to recover comprehensive input specifications by dynamically analyzing recursive descent parsers to infer semantic actions within attributed grammars, addressing gaps in existing grammar mining techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing grammar mining techniques focus on syntactic structures but fail to capture semantic input processing logic, leading to incomplete and outdated system specifications.

Method: The approach combines dynamic analysis of parser implementations with runtime input processing observation, mapping execution traces to grammar rules to systematically extract and embed semantic actions through attributed grammar synthesis.

Result: Initial implementation successfully reconstructed attributed grammars that accurately reproduce program behavior across multiple test programs, demonstrating the feasibility of semantic recovery from parsers.

Conclusion: The work establishes attributed grammar inference from parser code as a viable method for recovering semantic specifications, enabling more complete formal descriptions of input processing in software systems.

Abstract: Software systems that process structured inputs often lack complete and
up-to-date specifications, which specify the input syntax and the semantics of
input processing. While grammar mining techniques have focused on recovering
syntactic structures, the semantics of input processing remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for inferring
attributed grammars from parser implementations. Given an input grammar, our
technique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers
to reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in
specifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program
executions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we
systematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This
enables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of
our approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately
reproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars.

### [25] [Detecting LLM-generated Code with Subtle Modification by Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13123)
*Xin Yin,Xinrui Li,Chao Ni,Xiaodan Xu,Xiaohu Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeGPTSensor+ improves detection of modified LLM-generated code using adversarial training via the MIST module, achieving higher robustness and accuracy on the HMCorp dataset compared to CodeGPTSensor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of LLM-generated code in practical applications raises concerns about code provenance, copyright, and quality. Current detection methods lack robustness against minor code modifications, necessitating an effective solution for real-world scenarios.

Method: CodeGPTSensor+ introduces the Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST) module, which systematically generates high-quality adversarial samples. By adversarial training with these samples, the model enhances its resistance to diverse input perturbations, such as identifier changes and structural adjustments.

Result: On the HMCorp dataset, CodeGPTSensor+ demonstrates significantly higher detection accuracy on an adversarial test set (with modified code) compared to prior models, while maintaining strong performance on the original test set.

Conclusion: CodeGPTSensor+ addresses critical real-world challenges in detecting LLM-generated code post-modifications, providing superior robustness and ensuring its compliant and responsible use in coding tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their powerful
code-generation capabilities have been widely applied in tasks like code
completion and automated development, demonstrating the value of improving
coding efficiency. However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises
several new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code
provenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly
concerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its
compliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the
other hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to
manual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments.
Although some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods
for detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness
when facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective
solution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may
undergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of
CodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against
input perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation
module, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which
systematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial
samples. This module effectively enhances the model's resistance against
diverse adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the HMCorp dataset
demonstrate that CodeGPTSensor+ significantly improves detection accuracy on
the adversarial test set while maintaining high accuracy on the original test
set, showcasing superior robustness compared to CodeGPTSensor.
