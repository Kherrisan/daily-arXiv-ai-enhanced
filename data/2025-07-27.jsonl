Several approaches\nhave been proposed in the literature for detecting vulnerable codes and\nidentifying the classes of vulnerabilities. However, there is still room to\nwork in explaining the root causes of detected vulnerabilities through locating\nvulnerable statements and the discovery of paths leading to the activation of\nthe vulnerability. While frameworks like SliceLocator offer explanations by\nidentifying vulnerable paths, they rely on rule-based sink identification that\nlimits their generalization. In this paper, we introduce VulPathFinder, an\nexplainable vulnerability path discovery framework that enhances SliceLocator's\nmethodology by utilizing a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for detecting\nsink statements, rather than relying on predefined rules. The proposed GNN\ncaptures semantic and syntactic dependencies to find potential sink points\n(PSPs), which are candidate statements where vulnerable paths end. After\ndetecting PSPs, program slicing can be used to extract potentially vulnerable\npaths, which are then ranked by feeding them back into the target graph-based\ndetector. Ultimately, the most probable path is returned, explaining the root\ncause of the detected vulnerability. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach by performing evaluations on a benchmark of the buffer\noverflow CWEs from the SARD dataset, providing explanations for the\ncorresponding detected vulnerabilities. The results show that VulPathFinder\noutperforms both original SliceLocator and GNNExplainer (as a general GNN\nexplainability tool) in discovery of vulnerability paths to identified PSPs."}

Although both GNet\nand HNet are encapsulated in a black box (called operation network, or ONet),\nwith only the generated and marked outputs from HNet being released to end\nusers and deemed secure, in this paper, we reveal an overlooked vulnerability\nin such systems. Specifically, we show that the hidden GNet outputs can still\nbe reliably estimated via query-based reverse engineering, leaking the\ngenerated and unmarked images, despite the attacker's limited knowledge of the\nsystem. Our first attempt is to reverse-engineer an inverse model for HNet\nunder the stringent black-box condition, for which we propose to exploit the\nquery process with specially curated input images.

Furthermore, these can be used to evaluate\ncybersecurity configuration, effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures\nagainst various attack vectors, as well as to train smart grid cybersecurity\nexperts defending the system. Enabling extensive experiments narrows the gap\nbetween academic research and production environment. A high-fidelity cyber\nrange is vital as it is often infeasible to conduct such experiments and\ntraining using production environment. However, the design and implementation\nof cyber range requires extensive domain knowledge of physical and cyber aspect\nof the infrastructure. Furthermore, costs incurred for setup and maintenance of\ncyber range are significant. Moreover, most existing smart grid cyber ranges\nare designed as a one-off, proprietary system, and are limited in terms of\nconfigurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. To address\nthese challenges, an automated Smart grid Cyber Range generation framework is\npresented in this paper. Initially a human-/machine-friendly, XML-based\nmodeling language called Smart Grid Modeling Language was defined, which\nincorporates IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. Subsequently, a\ntoolchain to parse SG-ML model files and automatically instantiate a functional\nsmart grid cyber range was developed. The developed SG-ML models can be easily\nshared and/or modified to reproduce or customize for any cyber range. The\napplication of Auto-SGCR is demonstrated through case studies with large-scale\nsubstation models. The toolchain along with example SG-ML models have been\nopen-sourced."}

To develop software\nwithout requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the\nso-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used.

To overcome this\nlimitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic\nreasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested\nour approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including\nCodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining\nsymbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that\nthis approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review."}

In recent years,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to\nenhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant\ncontext from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing\nstudies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and\nbenchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and\nclosed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To\nmitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance\nof widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase\nof WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we\nextensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG\nand similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B\nparameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval\ntechniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.\nBased on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both\nRAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with\nsimilarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of\nsimilarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where\nBM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior\nperformance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval\ntechniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.\nFurthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of\nRAG methods in real-world development environments."}
