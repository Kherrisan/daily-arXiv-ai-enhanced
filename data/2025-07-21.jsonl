Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, vol\n  1191. Springer", "summary": "Steganography is the process of embedding secret information discreetly\nwithin a carrier, ensuring secure exchange of confidential data. The Adaptive\nPixel Value Differencing (APVD) steganography method, while effective,\nencounters certain challenges like the \"unused blocks\" issue. This problem can\ncause a decrease in security, compromise the embedding capacity, and lead to\nlower visual quality. This research presents a novel steganographic strategy\nthat integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to effectively mitigate\nthese issues. The results indicate that the new method outperforms existing\ntechniques in aspects of security, data hiding capacity, and the preservation\nof image quality. Empirical results reveal that the combination of APVD with\npseudorandom pixel selection significantly enhances key image quality metrics\nsuch as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQ),\nand Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), surpassing other contemporary methods\nin performance. The newly proposed method is versatile, able to handle a\nvariety of cover and secret images in both color and grayscale, thereby\nensuring secure data transmission without compromising the aesthetic quality of\nthe image."}

Despite their instructional relevance, these samples are\noften governed informally, with minimal review and unclear ownership, which\nincreases their exposure to socio-technical degradation. In this context, the\nco-occurrence and longitudinal interplay of code smells (e.g., large classes,\npoor modularity) and community smells (e.g., lone contributors, fragmented\ncommunication) become particularly critical. While each type of smell has been\nstudied in isolation, little is known about how community-level dysfunctions\nanticipate or exacerbate technical anomalies in code samples over time. This\nstudy investigates how code and community smells emerge, co-occur, and evolve\nwithin code samples maintained in OSSECOs. A Multivocal Literature Review\nprotocol was applied, encompassing 30 peer-reviewed papers and 17\npractitioner-oriented sources (2013-2024). Thematic synthesis was conducted to\nidentify recurring socio-technical patterns related to smell dynamics. Nine\npatterns were identified, showing that community smells often precede or\nreinforce technical degradation in code samples. Symptoms such as \"radio\nsilence\" and centralized ownership were frequently associated with persistent\nstructural anomalies. Additionally, limited onboarding, the absence of\ncontinuous refactoring, and informal collaboration emerged as recurring\nconditions for smell accumulation. Conclusion: In OSSECOs, particularly within\ncode samples, community-level dysfunctions not only correlate with but often\nsignal maintainability decay.

However, their strong instruction-following capabilities and\ninability to distinguish instructions from data content make them vulnerable to\nindirect prompt injection attacks. In such attacks, instructions with malicious\npurposes are injected into external data sources, such as web documents. When\nLLMs retrieve this injected data through tools, such as a search engine and\nexecute the injected instructions, they provide misled responses. Recent attack\nmethods have demonstrated potential, but their abrupt instruction injection\noften undermines their effectiveness. Motivated by the limitations of existing\nattack methods, we propose TopicAttack, which prompts the LLM to generate a\nfabricated conversational transition prompt that gradually shifts the topic\ntoward the injected instruction, making the injection smoother and enhancing\nthe plausibility and success of the attack. Through comprehensive experiments,\nTopicAttack achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an attack success rate\n(ASR) over 90\\% in most cases, even when various defense methods are applied.\nWe further analyze its effectiveness by examining attention scores.

This paper attempts to address this problem by exploring two\ncomplementary aspects.\n  First, it proposes a framework for comparing existing test methods in terms\nof their intrinsic effectiveness and validity. It shows that many methods do\nnot meet both of these requirements. Either because they are based on criteria\nthat do not allow for rapid, inexpensive, and comprehensive detection of\nfailures, or because the degree of validity of the properties tested cannot be\naccurately estimated. In particular, it is shown that most critical test\nmethods do not take into account the nominal operational capabilities of\nautopilots and generate scenarios that are impossible for the tested vehicles\nto handle, resulting in unjustified rejections.\n  Secondly, the paper shows that test effectiveness and validity are highly\ndependent on how autopilots are designed: how they choose between different\ncontrol policies to perform maneuvers, as well as on the reproducibility of the\nresults. In fact, most test methods take for granted two principles underlying\ntraditional methods, but do not generally apply to ADS. We maintain that the\nabsence of rationality and determinacy significantly impairs the effectiveness\nand validity of test methods, and provide test results on eight open\nautopilots, in which most do not satisfy these properties, thereby illustrating\nthis fact.\n  We conclude that under the current state of the art, it is impossible to\nobtain strong enough guarantees for essential autopilot properties and\nrecommend that autopilots be developed with a view to both rationality and\ndeterminacy."}
