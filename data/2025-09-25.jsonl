To bridge this gap, we formulate it as a semantic alignment problem\nbetween requirements and Verilog implementations, and propose VCD-RNK, a\ndiscriminator model tailored for efficient Verilog code reranking.\nSpecifically, VCD-RNKincorporates Verilog-specific reasoning by distilling\nexpert knowledge across three dimensions: code semantic analysis, test case\ngeneration, and functional correctness assessment. By explicitly simulating the\nabove reasoning processes during inference, VCD-RNK effectively avoids\ncomputationally intensive test execution in existing methods."}

Severe consequences may arise if\ndevelopers integrate insecure code snippets that are vulnerable to SSC attacks\ninto their products. Particularly, code generation techniques, such as large\nlanguage models (LLMs), have been widely utilized in the developer community.\nHowever, LLMs are known to suffer from inherent issues when generating code,\nincluding fabrication, misinformation, and reliance on outdated training data,\nall of which can result in serious software supply chain threats. In this\npaper, we investigate the security threats to the SSC that arise from these\ninherent issues. We examine three categories of threats, including eleven\npotential SSC-related threats, related to external components in source code,\nand continuous integration configuration files. We find some threats in\nLLM-generated code could enable attackers to hijack software and workflows,\nwhile some others might cause potential hidden threats that compromise the\nsecurity of the software over time. To understand these security impacts and\nseverity, we design a tool, SSCGuard, to generate 439,138 prompts based on\nSSC-related questions collected online, and analyze the responses of four\npopular LLMs from GPT and Llama. Our results show that all identified\nSSC-related threats persistently exist. To mitigate these risks, we propose a\nnovel prompt-based defense mechanism, namely Chain-of-Confirmation, to reduce\nfabrication, and a middleware-based defense that informs users of various SSC\nthreats."}

Privacy audits help\nto obtain empirical estimates of the privacy parameter, to expose flawed\nimplementations of algorithms and to compare practical with theoretical privacy\nguarantees. In this work, we investigate an unexplored facet of privacy\nauditing: the sustained auditing of a mechanism that can go through changes\nduring its development or deployment. Monitoring the privacy of algorithms over\ntime comes with specific challenges. Running state-of-the-art (static) auditors\nrepeatedly requires excessive sampling efforts, while the reliability of such\nmethods deteriorates over time without proper adjustments. To overcome these\nobstacles, we present a new monitoring procedure that extracts information from\nthe entire deployment history of the algorithm.

First, one needs to\n_generate inputs_ that are syntactically and semantically correct, yet\nsufficiently diverse to cover behavior. Second, one needs an _oracle_ to _check\noutputs_ whether a test case is correct or not. Both problems become apparent\nin _protocol testing_, where inputs are messages exchanged between parties, and\noutputs are the responses of these parties.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protocol testing that combines\ninput generation and output checking in a single framework. We introduce _I/O\ngrammars_ as the first means to _completely_ specify the syntax and semantics\nof protocols, including messages, states, and interactions. Our implementation,\nbased on the FANDANGO framework, takes a single I/O grammar, and can act as a\n_test generator_, as a _mock object_, and as an _oracle_ for a _client_, a\n_server_, or both (or actually any number of parties), a versatility not found\nin any existing tool or formalism. User-defined _constraints}_can have the\ngenerator focus on arbitrary protocol features; $k$-path guidance\nsystematically covers states, messages, responses, and value alternatives in a\nunified fashion.\n  We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several\nprotocols, including DNS, FTP, and SMTP. We demonstrate that I/O grammars can\nspecify advanced protocol features correctly and completely, while also\nenabling output validation of the programs under test. In its evaluation, we\nfind that systematic coverage of the I/O grammar results in much quicker\ncoverage of the input and response spaces (and thus functionality) compared to\nthe random-based state-of-the-art approaches."}

While RAG\nhas shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual\nconsistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ\nfrom those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that\nLLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or\nadversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At\nthe same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack\nsurfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or\ncontent of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to\nmanipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal\nframework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we\naddress a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We\nintroduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to\nmodel components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as\ndocument-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious\nprivacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments.

They promise cost reduction, transparency, and flexible\nservice provision. However, these markets usually have large workload that must\nbe processed in a timely manner, leading to serious scalability problems.\nDespite the large amount of work on blockchain scalability, existing solutions\nare ineffective as they do not account for these markets' work models and\ntraffic patterns.\n  We introduce chainScale, a secure hybrid sidechain-sharding solution that\naims to boost throughput of decentralized resource markets and reduce their\nlatency and storage footprint. At its core, chainScale leverages dependent\nsidechains and functionality-oriented workload splitting to parallelize traffic\nprocessing by having each market module assigned to a sidechain. Different from\nsharding, chainScale does not incur any cross-sidechain transactions that tend\nto be costly. chainScale introduces several techniques, including hierarchical\nworkload sharing that further sub-divides overloaded modules, and weighted\nminer assignment that assigns miners with vested interest in the system to\ncritical modules' sidechains. Furthermore, chainScale employs sidechain syncing\nto maintain the mainchain as the single truth of system state, and pruning to\ndiscard stale records. Beside analyzing security, we build a proof-of-concept\nimplementation for a distributed file storage market as a use case. Our\nexperiments show that, compared to a single sidechain-based prior solution,\nchainScale boosts throughput by 4x and reduces confirmation latency by 5x.\nAlso, they show that chainScale outperforms sharding by 2.5x in throughput and\n3.5x in latency."}
