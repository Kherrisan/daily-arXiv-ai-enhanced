Manual investigation of such a vast\namount of malware is an unrealistic, time-consuming, and overwhelming task. To\ncope with this volume, there is a clear need to develop specialized techniques\nand efficient tools for preliminary filtering that can group malware based on\nsemantic similarity. In this paper, we propose TrapNet, a novel, scalable, and\nunsupervised framework for malware fingerprinting and grouping. TrapNet employs\ngraph community detection techniques for malware fingerprinting and family\nattribution based on static analysis, as follows: (1) TrapNet detects packed\nbinaries and unpacks them using known generic packer tools. (2) From each\nmalware sample, it generates a digest that captures the underlying semantics.\nSince the digest must be dense, efficient, and suitable for similarity\nchecking, we designed FloatHash (FH), a novel numerical fuzzy hashing technique\nthat produces a short real-valued vector summarizing the underlying assembly\nitems and their order. FH is based on applying Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) to ordered assembly items (e.g., opcodes, function calls) extracted from\nthe malware's assembly code. (3) Representing malware with short numerical\nvectors enables high-performance, large-scale similarity computation, which\nallows TrapNet to build a malware similarity network. (4) Finally, TrapNet\nemploys state-of-the-art community detection algorithms to identify dense\ncommunities, which represent groups of malware with similar semantics. Our\nextensive evaluation of TrapNet demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of the\ncoverage and purity of the detected communities, while also highlighting its\nruntime efficiency, which outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions."}

However,\nexisting blockchain-based healthcare systems, while providing robust access\ncontrol, commonly overlook the high latency in user-side re-computation of\nhashes for integrity verification of large multimedia data, impairing their\npracticality, especially in time-sensitive clinical scenarios. In this paper,\nwe propose FAITH, an innovative scheme for \\underline{F}ast\n\\underline{A}uthenticated and \\underline{I}nteroperable mul\\underline{T}imedia\n\\underline{H}ealthcare data storage and sharing over hybrid-storage\nblockchains. Rather than user-side hash re-computations, FAITH lets an\noff-chain storage provider generate verifiable proofs using recursive\nZero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), while the user only needs to perform lightweight\nverification. For flexible access authorization, we leverage Proxy\nRe-Encryption (PRE) and enable the provider to conduct ciphertext\nre-encryption, in which the re-encryption correctness can be verified via ZKPs\nagainst the malicious provider. All metadata and proofs are recorded on-chain\nfor public verification. We provide a comprehensive analysis of FAITH's\nsecurity regarding data privacy and integrity. We implemented a prototype of\nFAITH, and extensive experiments demonstrated its practicality for\ntime-critical healthcare applications, dramatically reducing user-side\nverification latency by up to $98\\%$, bringing it from $4$ s down to around\n$70$ ms for a $5$ GB encrypted file."}

While recent research has explored\nleveraging model unlearning mechanisms to enhance backdoor concealment,\nexisting attack strategies still leave persistent traces that may be detected\nthrough static analysis. In this work, we introduce the first paradigm of\nrevocable backdoor attacks, where the backdoor can be proactively and\nthoroughly removed after the attack objective is achieved. We formulate the\ntrigger optimization in revocable backdoor attacks as a bilevel optimization\nproblem: by simulating both backdoor injection and unlearning processes, the\ntrigger generator is optimized to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR)\nwhile ensuring that the backdoor can be easily erased through unlearning. To\nmitigate the optimization conflict between injection and removal objectives, we\nemploy a deterministic partition of poisoning and unlearning samples to reduce\nsampling-induced variance, and further apply the Projected Conflicting Gradient\n(PCGrad) technique to resolve the remaining gradient conflicts. Experiments on\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate that our method maintains ASR comparable to\nstate-of-the-art backdoor attacks, while enabling effective removal of backdoor\nbehavior after unlearning.

Shadow model technique is\ncommonly employed in such attacks, such as membership inference. However, the\nneed for a large number of shadow models leads to high computational costs,\nlimiting their practical applicability. Such inefficiency mainly stems from the\nindependent training and use of these shadow models. To address this issue, we\npresent a novel shadow pool training framework SHAPOOL, which constructs\nmultiple shared models and trains them jointly within a single process. In\nparticular, we leverage the Mixture-of-Experts mechanism as the shadow pool to\ninterconnect individual models, enabling them to share some sub-networks and\nthereby improving efficiency. To ensure the shared models closely resemble\nindependent models and serve as effective substitutes, we introduce three novel\nmodules: path-choice routing, pathway regularization, and pathway alignment.\nThese modules guarantee random data allocation for pathway learning, promote\ndiversity among shared models, and maintain consistency with target models. We\nevaluate SHAPOOL in the context of various membership inference attacks and\nshow that it significantly reduces the computational cost of shadow model\nconstruction while maintaining comparable attack performance."}

Dynamic Expert Routing in Backdoored Mixture-of-Experts Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures\nachieve impressive performance and efficiency by dynamically routing inputs to\nspecialized subnetworks, known as experts. However, this sparse routing\nmechanism inherently exhibits task preferences due to expert specialization,\nintroducing a new and underexplored vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this\nwork, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of injecting backdoors\ninto MoE-based LLMs by exploiting their inherent expert routing preferences. We\nthus propose BadSwitch, a novel backdoor framework that integrates task-coupled\ndynamic trigger optimization with a sensitivity-guided Top-S expert tracing\nmechanism. Our approach jointly optimizes trigger embeddings during pretraining\nwhile identifying S most sensitive experts, subsequently constraining the Top-K\ngating mechanism to these targeted experts. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks\nthat rely on superficial data poisoning or model editing, BadSwitch primarily\nembeds malicious triggers into expert routing paths with strong task affinity,\nenabling precise and stealthy model manipulation. Through comprehensive\nevaluations across three prominent MoE architectures (Switch Transformer,\nQwenMoE, and DeepSeekMoE), we demonstrate that BadSwitch can efficiently hijack\npre-trained models with up to 100% success rate (ASR) while maintaining the\nhighest clean accuracy (ACC) among all baselines. Furthermore, BadSwitch\nexhibits strong resilience against both text-level and model-level defense\nmechanisms, achieving 94.07% ASR and 87.18% ACC on the AGNews dataset. Our\nanalysis of expert activation patterns reveals fundamental insights into MoE\nvulnerabilities. We anticipate this work will expose security risks in MoE\nsystems and contribute to advancing AI safety."}

This paper presents the\nresults of a qualitative interview study with N = 33 BLV participants. We found\nthat all participants utilize password managers to some extent, which they\nperceive as fairly accessible. However, the adoption is mainly driven by the\nconvenience of storing and retrieving passwords. The security advantages -\ngenerating strong, random passwords - were avoided mainly due to the absence of\npractical accessibility. Password managers do not adhere to BLV users'\nunderlying needs for agency, which stem from experiences with inaccessible\nsoftware and vendors who deprioritize accessibility issues. Underutilization of\npassword managers leads BLV users to adopt insecure practices, such as reusing\npredictable passwords or resorting to 'security through obscurity' by writing\nimportant credentials in braille.
