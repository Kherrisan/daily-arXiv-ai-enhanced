These shifts raise urgent questions about when AI systems introduce unacceptable or intolerable cyber risk, and how risk thresholds should be identified before harms materialize at scale. In recent years, industry, government, and civil society actors have begun to articulate such thresholds for advanced AI systems, with the goal of signaling when models meaningfully amplify cyber threats, for example, by automating multi-stage intrusions, enabling zero-day discovery, or lowering the expertise required for sophisticated attacks. However, current approaches to determine these thresholds remain fragmented and limited. Many thresholds rely solely on capability benchmarks or narrow threat scenarios, and are weakly connected to empirical evidence. This paper proposes a structured approach to developing and evaluating AI cyber risk thresholds that is probabilistic, evidence-based, and operationalizable. In this paper we make three core contributions that build on our prior work that highlights the limitations of relying solely on capability assessments. First, we analyze existing industry cyber thresholds and identify common threshold elements as well as recurring methodological shortcomings. Second, we propose the use of Bayesian networks as a tool for modeling AI-enabled cyber risk, enabling the integration of heterogeneous evidence, explicit representation of uncertainty, and continuous updating as new information emerges. Third, we illustrate this approach through a focused case study on AI-augmented phishing, demonstrating how qualitative threat insights can be decomposed into measurable variables and recombined into structured risk estimates that better capture how AI changes attacker behavior and outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a probabilistic, evidence-based framework using Bayesian networks to assess AI cyber risk thresholds, addressing limitations in current approaches and demonstrating its application in AI-augmented phishing.", "motivation": "The motivation stems from the growing use of AI in cyber operations, which amplifies threats in scale and accessibility.

In this paper, we introduce Res-MIA, a novel training-free and black-box membership inference attack that exploits the sensitivity of deep models to high-frequency input details. Res-MIA progressively degrades the input resolution using controlled downsampling and restoration operations, and analyzes the resulting confidence decay in the model's predictions. Our key insight is that training samples exhibit a significantly steeper confidence decline under resolution erosion compared to non-member samples, revealing a robust membership signal. Res-MIA requires no shadow models, no auxiliary data, and only a limited number of forward queries to the target model. We evaluate the proposed attack on a federated ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10, where it consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines and achieves an AUC of up to 0.88 with minimal computational overhead.

Their solution is able to match~$32$ users against a database of~$2^{22}$ iris codes in~$\\approx 2$s , using~24 H100 GPUs, more than 40~communication rounds and $81$GB/party of data transferred (the timing assumes a network speed above~3Tb/s).\n  In the present work, we explore the use of Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (ThFHE) for the same task. The ThFHE solution brings a number of security advantages: no trusted setup, the encrypted database and queries can be public, the secret can be distributed among many parties, and active security can be added without significant performance degradation.\n  Our proof-of-concept implementation of the computation phase handles $32$~eyes against a database of $7\\cdot 2^{14}$ iris codes in~$\\approx 1.8$s ($\\approx 0.33s$ for 4 eyes against the same database), using 8 RTX-5090 GPUs. To this, one should add~2 to 3 rounds of communication (depending on deployment choice). We perform the matching using the CKKS (Th)FHE scheme. Our main technical ingredients are the use of recent progress on FHE-based linear algebra boosted using int8 GPU operations, and the introduction of a technique reducing the number of ciphertexts to be processed as early as possible.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (ThFHE)-based solution for privacy-preserving large-scale iris recognition, demonstrating faster computation and stronger security guarantees than prior MPC-based approaches.", "motivation": "Iris recognition systems like World ID handle massive biometric databases, raising privacy concerns.

Objective: This paper audits recent software defect prediction (SDP) studies by assessing their experimental design, analysis, and reporting practices against accepted norms from statistics, machine learning, and empirical software engineering. The aim is to characterise current practice and assess the reproducibility of published results. Method: We audited SDP studies indexed in SCOPUS between 2019 and 2023, focusing on design and analysis choices such as outcome measures, out of sample validation strategies, and the use of statistical inference. Nine study issues were evaluated. Reproducibility was assessed using the instrument proposed by Gonz\u00e1lez Barahona and Robles. Results: The search identified approximately 1,585 SDP experiments published during the period. From these, we randomly sampled 101 papers, including 61 journal and 40 conference publications, with almost 50 percent behind paywalls. We observed substantial variation in research practice. The number of datasets ranged from 1 to 365, learners or learner variants from 1 to 34, and performance measures from 1 to 9. About 45 percent of studies applied formal statistical inference. Across the sample, we identified 427 issues, with a median of four per paper, and only one paper without issues. Reproducibility ranged from near complete to severely limited.

In this context, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) has emerged as a primary cryptographic solution to provide non-interactive confidential LLM inference. Existing solutions scale poorly with the input token length, and hence focus either on small models or larger models with a small number of input tokens. They also suffer from the existence of large outlier values. These values have a strong impact on the evaluation of non-linear layers, leading to large-degree polynomial approximation and thus heavy evaluation costs.\n  We propose an FHE-based private LLM inference solution that allows thousands of input tokens with only a part of them being encrypted: this fits with a scenario where the context is benign and only part of the input is sensitive. To do so, we suggest an unbalanced chunked prefill framework that processes the private and public parts of the input tokens differently. Our framework contains plaintext-plaintext, plaintext-ciphertext and ciphertext-ciphertext computational components. We adopt different strategies and ingredients for each component. We also devise new homomorphic algorithms for specific matrix multiplication and polynomial evaluation tasks encountered during LLM inference.\n  Furthermore, without retraining, we tailor the LLM inference algorithm to reduce the ranges of outlier values: we leverage machine learning strategies (token prepending and rotations) to mitigate the impact of the outliers on non-linear layers.\n  Based on these ingredients, we describe a CKKS-based end-to-end implementation of Llama-2-7B private inference for up to 4096 input tokens, of which the last 128 are encrypted. On a cluster of 8~NVIDIA RTX-4090 GPUs, inference takes 85s for summarization and 33s for generation per output token.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": ""}}

Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $\u03b1^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $\u03b1^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage).\n  We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent.
