To address this issue, we present a novel approach,\nAnti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within\nthe perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations,\nwhere the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the\nauthorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both\nprotection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain\nunder the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does\nnot disrupt the authorization perturbation. This design also enables the\nauthorization perturbation to be distributed across all image pixels,\npreserving its sensitivity to purification-based tampering. ATP demonstrates\nits effectiveness in defending forgery attacks across various attack settings\nthrough extensive experiments, providing a robust solution for protecting\nindividuals' portrait rights and privacy.

Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based\nagents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal\nhuman intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost\nsavings.\n  In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions,\nshowing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security\ncost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to\nmislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the\ninfrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject\ntelemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior\nthrough a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system\nerror interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack\nmethodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing,\nand LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior\nknowledge of the target system.\n  To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that\nsanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal\nrole of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably\nblocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance.\n  Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system\ncompromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design."}

In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent\nbuilt on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts\nthat simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on\nsingle-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts\ndynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion\nstrategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety\nguardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective\nagainst such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level\nsafeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered\nincrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the\ntransformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern\ntext-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our\nfindings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level\ncontrol frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational\ndeception powered by generative AI."}

In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols\nand develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and\nsimulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable\nto incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller\nprofitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we\nintroduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both\nNakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical\nperspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction\nconflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair\ndistribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use\nstate-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and\nconsider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about\nthe resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks."}
