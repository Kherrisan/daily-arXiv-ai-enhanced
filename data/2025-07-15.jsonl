We define immutability as\nthe cryptographic persistence of historical states in an append-only data\nstructure and contrast it with trust, understood as a rational epistemic\nexpectation under uncertainty. Employing predicate logic, automata-theoretic\nmodels, and epistemic game-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate that immutability\nneither entails nor implies correctness, fairness, or credibility. Through\nformal constructions and counterexamples--including predictive fraud schemes\nand the phenomenon of garbage permanence--we show that the belief conflates\nstructural and epistemic domains. Immutability preserves all data equally,\nregardless of veracity. Therefore, the assertion that immutability guarantees\ntrust collapses under the weight of formal scrutiny."}

Branch-based workflows typically define a set of remote branches\nwith well-defined objectives, such as feature branches, a branch for feature\nintegration, and a main branch.

However, existing unlearning\nmethods mainly focus on recovering trigger patterns but fail to restore the\ncorrect semantic labels of poison samples. This limitation prevents them from\nfully eliminating the false correlation between the trigger pattern and the\ntarget label. To address this, we leverage boundary adversarial attack\ntechniques, revealing two key observations. First, poison samples exhibit\nsignificantly greater distances from decision boundaries compared to clean\nsamples, indicating they require larger adversarial perturbations to change\ntheir predictions. Second, while adversarial predicted labels for clean samples\nare uniformly distributed, those for poison samples tend to revert to their\noriginal correct labels. Moreover, the features of poison samples restore to\nclosely resemble those of corresponding clean samples after adding adversarial\nperturbations. Building upon these insights, we propose Backdoor Unlearning via\nadversaRial bouNdary analysis (BURN), a novel defense framework that integrates\nfalse correlation decoupling, progressive data refinement, and model\npurification. In the first phase, BURN employs adversarial boundary analysis to\ndetect poisoned samples based on their abnormal adversarial boundary distances,\nthen restores their correct semantic labels for fine-tuning. In the second\nphase, it employs a feedback mechanism that tracks prediction discrepancies\nbetween the original backdoored model and progressively sanitized models,\nguiding both dataset refinement and model purification.
