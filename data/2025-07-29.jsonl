Making Web pages accessible to all users\nrequires dedicated expertise and additional manual efforts from Web page\nproviders. To lower their efforts and promote inclusiveness, we aim to\nautomatically detect and correct Web accessibility violations in HTML code.\nWhile previous work has made progress in detecting certain types of\naccessibility violations, the problem of automatically detecting and correcting\naccessibility violations remains an open challenge that we address. We\nintroduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three\nkey categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout. This taxonomy provides a\nstructured foundation for developing our detection and correction method and\nredefining evaluation metrics. We propose a novel method, AccessGuru, which\ncombines existing accessibility testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto detect violations and applies taxonomy-driven prompting strategies to\ncorrect all three categories. To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a\nbenchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies\nsyntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through\ncomparative analysis with human expert corrections.

To understand\nthe impact that generic structured merge might have on merge accuracy and\nperformance, we run an experiment with four structured merge tools: two Java\nspecific tools, jDime and Spork, and their generic counterparts, respectively\nLastMerge and Mergiraf. Using each tool, we replay merge scenarios from a\nsignificant dataset, and collect data on runtime, behavioral divergences, and\nmerge accuracy. Our results show no evidence that generic structured merge\nsignificantly impacts merge accuracy.

Therefore, we first formalize the notion of\nrecovery metadata in the context of social key recovery, illustrating the\ntradeoff between easing the burden of memorizing the metadata and maintaining\nmetadata privacy. We present Apollo, the first framework that addresses this\ntradeoff by distributing indistinguishable data within a user's social circle,\nwhere trustees hold relevant data and non-trustees store random data. Apollo\neliminates the need to memorize recovery metadata since a user eventually\ngathers sufficient data from her social circle for recovery. Due to\nindistinguishability, Apollo protects metadata privacy by forming an anonymity\nset that hides the trustees among non-trustees. To make the anonymity set\nscalable, Apollo proposes a novel multi-layered secret sharing scheme that\nmitigates the overhead due to the random data distributed among non-trustees.\nFinally, we provide a prototype implementation of Apollo and report on its\nperformance.

In\nresponse, a significant body of research has focused on identifying and\nmitigating smart contract vulnerabilities. However, these efforts predominantly\nfocus on implementation-level bugs, leaving a critical gap between academic\nunderstanding of vulnerabilities and the root causes of real-world high-impact\nfinancial losses. We employ a two-pronged methodology: first, a systematic\nliterature review of 71 academic papers to build a comprehensive and up-to-date\ncatalog of 24 active and 5 deprecated vulnerabilities as understood by the\nresearch community. Second, we conduct an in-depth, empirical analysis of 50 of\nthe most severe real-world exploits between 2022 and 2025, collectively\nincurring over \\$1.09B in losses, to identify their true root causes. We\nintroduce the concept of \"exploit chains\" by revealing that many incidents are\nnot caused by isolated vulnerabilities but by combinations of human,\noperational, and economic design flaws that link with implementation bugs to\nenable an attack. Our analysis yields insights on how DApps are exploited in\npractice, leading to a novel, four-tier root-cause framework that moves beyond\ncode-level vulnerabilities. We find that real-world successful attacks on\nEthereum (and related networks) trace back to one of the four tiers of (1)\nprotocol logic design, (2) lifecycle and governance, (3) external dependencies,\nand (4) traditional implementation bugs (classic smart contract\nvulnerabilities). We investigate the suitability of this multi-tier incident\nroot-cause framework via a case study."}

Existing automated logging techniques focus on isolated\nsub-tasks - predicting a single log position, level, or message - and therefore\ncannot produce complete, high-quality log statements that reflect real-world\npractice in which multiple logs often appear inside one method. They also\nneglect deeper semantic dependencies among methods and consider only a narrow\nset of candidate variables, leading to superficial or incomplete logs. In this\npaper, we present PDLogger, the first end-to-end log generation technique\nexpressly designed for practical, multi-log scenarios. PDLogger operates in\nthree phases. (1) Log position prediction: block-type-aware structured prompts\nguide a large language model (LLM) to suggest candidate positions across all\ncontrol-flow blocks of a method. (2) Log generation: backward program slicing\nsupplies precise inter-procedural control and data-dependency context, while an\nexpanded variable extractor captures both member and external function\nexpressions; the enriched prompt enables the LLM to emit a full log statement\n(position, level, message, variables). (3) Log refinement: level correction and\ncontext-sensitive deduplication prune false positives and redundant logs. We\nevaluate PDLogger on 3,113 log statements drawn from two widely used Java\nprojects. Compared with the strongest prior systems, PDLogger improves\nlog-position precision by 139.0 percent, F1 by 69.2 percent, level accuracy by\n82.3 percent, variable precision by 131.8 percent, and message quality\n(BERTScore) by 65.7 percent. The framework consistently performs well with\ndifferent mainstream LLMs, demonstrating robustness and generality.

We will also seek developer feedback\non the quality and usability of the generated configurations. We formulate\nresearch questions focusing on the accuracy of LLM-generated migrations versus\nground truth and the output of CIMig. The expected contributions include the\nfirst LLM-powered approach for CI service migration, a comparative evaluation\nof its effectiveness compared to rule-based approaches, and insight into\nleveraging LLMs to support software configuration evolution."}

To better understand these experiences, we conducted a study\nwith software testing professionals to explore the nature of challenging tasks\nin software testing and how they affect these professionals.

Faults (e.g., transmission errors,\nhardware malfunctions, or synchronization failures) can corrupt encrypted data\nand compromise the integrity of HE operations. However, the impact of soft\nerrors (such as bit flips) on modern HE schemes remains unexplored.\nSpecifically, the CKKS scheme-one of the most widely used HE schemes for\napproximate arithmetic-lacks a systematic study of how such errors propagate\nacross its pipeline, particularly under optimizations like the Residue Number\nSystem (RNS) and Number Theoretic Transform (NTT).

We focus on client-side operations (encoding,\nencryption, decryption, and decoding) and demonstrate that while the vanilla\nCKKS scheme exhibits some resilience, performance optimizations (RNS/NTT)\nintroduce significant fragility, amplifying error sensitivity.

While\nnumerous automated techniques have been proposed for generating tests (either\nby maximizing code coverage or by translating focal code into test code),\npractical tests are seldom driven by coverage alone. In real projects, each\ntest reflects a developer's validation intention for a specific behaviour and\nembodies rich, project-specific knowledge: which specific APIs to call and what\nassertions truly matter. Without considering such knowledge, tests can hardly\npass code review and be integrated into the software product.\n  In this work, we propose IntentionTest, which generates project-specific\ntests with validation intention as a structured description. Our design is\nmotivated by two insights: (1) a description of validation intention, compared\nto coverage and focal code, carries more crucial information about what to\ntest; and (2) practical tests exhibit high code duplication, indicating that\ndomain knowledge is highly reusable for writing new tests. Given a focal code\nand a description of validation intention (in the form of either an informal\ncomment or a formal test plan), IntentionTest retrieves a referable test in the\nproject to guide test generation. Moreover, IntentionTest reduces the test\ngeneration problem into an editing problem on the test code regarding the\nvalidation intention. It generates a test including both test prefix and\noracle, which aims to be executable and semantically correct.\n  We evaluate IntentionTest against state-of-the-art baselines on 4,146 test\ncases from 13 open-source projects.

However,\nintegrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant\nchallenge. While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,\na subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives\n-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing\nthese errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often\ngenerate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability\nerror demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,\noften spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system\nthat integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a\nnullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived\nfrom manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to\nidentify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage\nexamples to contextualize model prompts. Patches are generated through an\niterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and\ndecision logic. Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that\nNullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying\na state-of-the-art annotation inference technique. Unlike a naively-prompted\nLLM, NullRepair also largely preserves program semantics, with all unit tests\npassing in 10/12 projects after applying every edit proposed by NullRepair, and\n98% or more tests passing in the remaining two projects."}

As libraries evolve, they may break the\ntacit contract established with their clients by introducing behavioral\nbreaking changes (BBCs) that alter run-time behavior and silently break client\napplications without being detected at compile time. Traditional regression\ntests on the client side often fail to detect such BBCs, either due to limited\nlibrary coverage or weak assertions that do not sufficiently exercise the\nlibrary's expected behavior. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach\nto client--library compatibility testing that leverages existing client tests\nin a novel way. Instead of relying on developer-written assertions, we propose\nrecording the actual interactions at the API boundary during the execution of\nclient tests (protocol, input and output values, exceptions, etc.). These\nsequences of API interactions are stored as snapshots which capture the exact\ncontract expected by a client at a specific point in time. As the library\nevolves, we compare the original and new snapshots to identify perturbations in\nthe contract, flag potential BBCs, and notify clients. We implement this\ntechnique in our prototype tool Gilesi, a Java framework that automatically\ninstruments library APIs, records snapshots, and compares them.
